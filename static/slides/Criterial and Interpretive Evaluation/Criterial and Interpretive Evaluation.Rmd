# Defining Evaluations 

.bg-washed.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
**Evaluation** is the act or process of determining the ***merit***, ***worth***, or ***significance*** of something or the product of that process.
]

# Explaining it to Everyone Else 

.bg-washed.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
**Evaluation** answers ***if it works?*** and ***why does it work?***
]

We typically leave the ***if it works?*** to people with grounded knowledge in a partocular area called *content experts*. 

---

#  Merit, Worth & Significance 

+ What do ***merit***, ***worth***,and ***significance*** mean to you both separately and combined?

+ Can you think of real world examples of each?

---

#  Evaluation 

+ Evaluation is the act or process of determining the *merit* (***quality***), *worth* (***value***), or *significance* (***importance***) of something or the product of that process.

Evaluator
Who you are matters… more on this later

#  Defining Culture 

What is culture? How do we recognize it ?
“ Culture can be defined as the shared experiences of people, including their languages, values, customs, beliefs, and more. It also includes worldviews, ways of knowing, and ways of communicating. Culturally significant factors encompass, but are not limited to, race/ethnicity, religion, social class, language, disability, sexual orientation, age, and gender.” (AEA, 2011).
