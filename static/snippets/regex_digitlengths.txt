1. The validations are in the right panel.
2. The one we want is Custom Validation. If you click on it a popup will appear.
3. In the first dropdown, select this question number Q30 if it is not already the default.
4. In the second column select the text associated with the question.
5. In the third column select Matches Regex.
6. Type or copy and past this: ^[0-9]{1,99}$
7. Select a validation message on the bottom or create one where it states Choose an error message to display on failure: ^[0-9]{1,99}$.

8. You can also use the javascript command to edit the length of the text box without having to do it manually. I covered this way back in Week 3: https://edp619.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example/
