<div id="course-objectives" class="section level2">
<h2>Course objectives</h2>
<p>Students will become proficient in the following aspects:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Administering surveys via the Internet.</li>
<li>Constructing online surveys.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>Creating aesthetically pleasing surveys using color theory and design techniques<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</li>
<li>Determining how to assess survey reliability and validity of items and instruments.</li>
<li>Enhancing the look and feel of surveys using programming techniques.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li>Evaluating what analysis technique to utilize for a given item, performing said analysis, and determining how best to report findings.</li>
<li>Using R and RStudio to pull, analyze, and construct reports on survey data.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="faq" class="section level2">
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div id="is-the-course-content-difficult" class="section level3">
<h3>Is the course content difficult?</h3>
<p>You’ve probably heard an answer like this before: <em>At times some of the material can be dense.</em> Well that isn’t much of a response. Difficulty is not the issue here since as humans with differing educational background, we will have strengths in some areas more than others. Instead the question is can you identify areas that need strengthened and communicate them? If you can, then you have a good shot at succeeding in this class.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-r-difficult" class="section level3">
<h3>Is R difficult?</h3>
<p>Learning R can be especially challenging at first—it’s akin to learning a new language like Spanish or even mathematics. Even experienced R users get frustrated…and so much so that some of us have swear jars. However as silly as it sounds one of the best feelings is to overcome a roadblock. With that said, if you find yourself getting irritated, try the following: take a break, go let some frustration out, sleep, discuss with a peer, etc. If you are at your limit, take a few breaths and contact me!</p>
</div>
<div id="what-if-i-find-a-mistake" class="section level3">
<h3>What if I find a mistake?</h3>
<p>Tell me! I strive to be error free but like everyone else, make silly mistakes. This includes grammar and spelling errors as well!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="course-materials" class="section level2">
<h2>Course materials</h2>
<p>There are two texts and three software packages necessary for this course. With that said, you will receive some supplementary materials in the course as well.</p>
<div id="texts" class="section level3">
<h3>Texts</h3>
<p>We’ll rely on the texts below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dillman, D.A., Smyth, J.D., and Christian, L.M. (2014). <em>Internet, Phone, Mail, and Mixed-Mode Surveys: The Tailored Design Method</em> (4th ed.). Wiley.</p></li>
<li><p>American Psychological Association. (2020). <em>Publication manual of the American Psychological Association</em> (7th ed.).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There will occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the content page for that session.</p>
<p>Subscribing to the <a href="https://rweekly.org/" target="_blank">R Weekly newsletter</a> provides many helpful tutorials about how to do R. This certainly is not a requirement.</p>
</div>
<div id="software" class="section level3">
<h3>Software</h3>
<div id="quatrics" class="section level4">
<h4>Quatrics</h4>

<div id="r-and-rstudio" class="section level4">
<h4>R and RStudio</h4>
<p>You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a>. You will use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">RStudio</a> as the main program to access R. <strong>Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard</strong> — R handles all the calculations produces the actual statistics and graphical output, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code. Please note that</p>
<div class="text-center">
<p><strong>you do not need to have any programming experience to use R</strong></p>
</div>
<p>R is free, but it can sometimes be a task to install and configure. To make life easier, you can opt to use the free <a href="http://rstudio.cloud/" target="_blank">RStudio.cloud</a> service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This is recommended for those of you who do not want to install programs right now but please note that you will most likely have to in the near future.</p>
<p>The service is convenient, but please keep in mind that it can be slow and is not designed to handle large data sets or more complicated analysis and graphics. You also cannot customize much with RStudio.cloud. Over the course of the term, you’ll want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud.</p>
<p>You can <a href="/resource/install/">find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="note-online-help" class="section level3">
<h3>Note: Online help</h3>
<p>Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your commands can cause hours of headache. People working in any syntax based software package at any level experience this!</p>
<p>Fortunately there are many online resources to help.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First you will have access to <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/" target="_blank">Data Camp</a> which allows you to recieve professional training that otherwise costs a lot of money. Is it perfect and flashy? Nope but it is interactive and if you pay attention, then R’s initial steep learning curve won’t feel like an uphill battle.</p></li>
<li><p>Second two of the most important are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> (a Q&amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">RStudio Community</a> (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)). I freely admit that StackOverflow has saved me multiple hours of frustration. Just note if you have a syntax or process issue, both sites require you to produce a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example" target="_blank">minimally reproducible example</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Third using Twitter you can post R-related questions and content with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats" target="_blank">#rstats</a>. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.</p></li>
<li><p>Fourth searching for help with R on Google (or another indexed search site) can sometimes be tricky because the program name is,for a lack of a better explanation, a single letter.</p></li>
<li><p>Fifth we have a class chatroom at <a href="2020edp619.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> where you can poise a question. <strong>I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond quickly.</strong> (This is a rare instances where I keep notifications on so please utilize it!) Ask questions about the readings, exercises, and mini projects. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too.</p></li>
<li><p>Sixth and lastly you can send items by Slack or email me with questions about content, R or whatever (after giving a graduate student effort of course). Please include the subject header <strong>EDP 619 “the title of your email”</strong> where the title of your email is given without the quotes. Know that I will not just give you the answer, but am happy to push you in the right direction. If you do email me, please include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brief description of the problem and what you have done thus far including the line number of the issue (if applicable).</li>
<li>A copy of your data set (if applicable).</li>
<li>A copy of your script or Rmarkdown document with comments throughout so I know what you’ve tried historically leading up to the issue.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I have a mail filter that will automatically bring your email to a top priority status.^ [In this new normal, I receive an overwhelming number of emails per day and may miss yours if the header is not formatted properly.]</p>
<p>You should absolutely expect to struggle at times, but there is no better and more satisfying feeling than figuring things out for yourself! In the long run, you’re more likely to remember things you’ve figured out rather than those you’ve been shown or told.</p>

<h3>Your hours</h3>

<p>Your hours (formerly known as office hours) are set times dedicated to you the student!<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>). This means that I will be <del>in my office</del> at home waiting for you to <del>come by</del> talk to me remotely with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.</p>
<p>Because of the pandemic, we cannot meet in person. I can meet you online via Zoom. You can request a meeting through either e-mail or Slack.</p>
</div>
<div id="class-conduct-and-expectations" class="section level3">
<h3>Class conduct and expectations</h3>
<p>Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up or stole from other professors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Late work</strong>: Barring the final project, past due deliverables will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via eCampus. There are no exceptions to this policy. Please note that I will not accept coursework by email or any other means.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Participation</strong>: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate in class. Engagement is mostly defined by you—if that means commenting and answering questions, neat; if it means sitting quietly and being focused, also neat; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off, not so neat.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rubrics</strong>: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level, I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), there is (typically) no such document as a rubric.</li>
<li>If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up).</li>
<li>Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor.</li>
<li>Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology use</strong>: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. You’re all adults…well I am most of the time.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Learning during a pandemic</h3>
<p>There’s really no other way to say it - life sucks right now!</p>
<p>You probably know people who have lost their jobs, tested positive for COVID-19, been hospitalized, or have even died. Additionally your work responsibilities have most likely shifted, coming with it added stress and worries. Please take note of the following:</p>
<div class="text-center">
<p><strong>I am fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class!</strong></p>
</div>
<p>I will make whatever reasonable and feasible accommodations I can to help you learn the course material, finish your tasks, and to understand what areas you may need to concentrate on. Under pandemic conditions, I am flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges provided that <em>you keep an open line of communication!</em> Furthermore, if you feel like you are behind or not understanding everything, <strong>do not suffer in silence!</strong> Please talk to me!</p>
<p>I selfishly want you to learn lots of things from this class (design! analysis! R! creating visualizations!, proving that <span class="math inline">\(0.99999\ldots = 1\)</span> - ok maybe not that last one but its true!). With all of that said, I first want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.</p>

<h2>Course policies</h2>
<div class="text-center">
<p><strong>Its pretty simple: Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat. Be a good human.</strong></p>

<div id="covid-19-statement" class="section level2">
<h2>COVID-19 Statement</h2>
<p>WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.</p>
<p>In a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe the social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines set by the University at all times. While in class, students will sit in assigned seats when applicable and wear the required PPE. Should a student forget to bring the required PPE, PPE will be available in the building for students to acquire. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.</p>
<p>If a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes.</p>

</div>
<div id="course-netiquette" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Netiquette</h3>
<p>The basic premise is that the etiquette expected of students in the online environment is the same as that expected in a classroom. Common courtesy is the guiding rule of Internet communications. Be prepared to communicate effectively when taking an online course. Following these simple netiquette rules in your online class or education environment will ensure your success:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include a professional salutation. In this case, “Hello Dr. Roy” or “Dear Dr. Roy” is appropriate.</li>
<li>Include a proper ending such as “Thank you” or “With regards.” Then type in your full name.</li>
<li>Never type in ALL CAPS, because it reads as if you ARE SHOUTING AT PEOPLE.</li>
<li>Act as professionally, via your writing, as you would in a face to face classroom.</li>
<li>Refrain from inappropriate language and derogatory or personal attacks.</li>
<li>Do not dominate any discussion. Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion.</li>
<li>Disagree with ideas but avoid challenges that may be interpreted as a personal attack.</li>
<li>Check that you are replying to the specific person you intend, and not to the entire class.</li>
<li>Never give your password to another person.</li>
<li>Respect the virtual classroom. Never forward in-class communications or posts by others outside of this virtual space.</li>
<li>Never spam your classmates.</li>
<li>If you quote someone’s previous post, only quote enough to make your point.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware of the University’s Academic Integrity and Dishonesty Policy <a href="http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext" target="_blank">http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext</a>.

</div>
<div id="response-time" class="section level3">
<h3>Response Time</h3>
<p>I generally respond to Slack queries in the same day while responses to emails and discussion posts are within 48 hours, except during holidays. Often, I will reply much more quickly but you should not count on a immediate. Please plan accordingly so that you don’t miss deadlines! I generally return assignments within one to two weeks after a final submission date.</p>
</div>
<div id="technical-requirements" class="section level3">
