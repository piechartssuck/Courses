&lt;h2&gt;First Things First! Set your Working Directory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;em&gt;working directory&lt;/em&gt; is simply where your script will look for anything it needs like external data sets. There are a few ways to go about doing this which we will cover. However for now, just do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up a new script by going to &lt;code&gt;File &amp;gt; New File &amp;gt; R Script&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save it in a preferably empty folder as whatever you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the menu bar and select &lt;code&gt;Session &amp;gt; Set Working Directory &amp;gt; To Source File Location&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;download-the-script&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download the script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copying and pasting syntax from a browser can cause problems. To avoid this issue, please download a script with all of the needed code presented in this walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Foundational Structures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akin to how atoms were viewed as the building blocks of life, these are the basic structures of R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;vector&lt;/em&gt; - The very basic structure of R where one type of information can be stored. These are given by a single row or column of things that have to be the same data type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;nothing_vector &amp;lt;- c()

nothing_vector&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## NULL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;number_vector &amp;lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)

number_vector&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 1 2 3 4 5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;character_vector &amp;lt;- 
  c(
    &amp;quot;Oban&amp;quot;, 
    &amp;quot;Macallan&amp;quot;, 
    &amp;quot;Pittyvaich&amp;quot;, 
    &amp;quot;Balblair&amp;quot;, 
    &amp;quot;Glenmorangie&amp;quot;
    )

character_vector&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;Oban&amp;quot;         &amp;quot;Macallan&amp;quot;     &amp;quot;Pittyvaich&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;Balblair&amp;quot;     &amp;quot;Glenmorangie&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt; - These are the different ways you can structure your data to do something with it. All objects are made up of one or more vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;data-types&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are six types of data that R can read on its own without the help of any other piece of software. These are known as atomic vectors where &lt;em&gt;atomic&lt;/em&gt; means the vector only holds data of a single type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;character: “a”, “swc”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;numeric: 2, 15.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;integer: 2L (the L tells R to store this as an integer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;logical: TRUE, FALSE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;complex: 1+4i (complex numbers with real and imaginary parts)&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;raw: 01010010&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;classes&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Classes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt; is the blueprint that helps to create an object. These are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;matrix&lt;/em&gt; - A two-dimensional object made up of rows and columns. These are essentially a bunch of vectors stacked on top or beside each other that have to be the same data type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;some_matrix &amp;lt;- matrix(c(1,1,2,3,5,8), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)

some_matrix &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    2    5
## [2,]    1    3    8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;array&lt;/em&gt; - A three-dimensional object made up of a bunch of matrices that have to be the same data type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;some_array &amp;lt;- array(1, dim = c(2, 3, 3))

some_array&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## , , 1
## 
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    1    1
## [2,]    1    1    1
## 
## , , 2
## 
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    1    1
## [2,]    1    1    1

## [1,]    1    1    1
## [2,]    1    1    1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;dataframe&lt;/em&gt; - Similar to a matrix, BUT columns can vary by data type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;some_df &amp;lt;- data.frame(col1 = 1:3, 
                 col2 = c(&amp;quot;take&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;nap&amp;quot;), 
                 col3 = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
                 col4 = c(1.5, 3.2, pi))

some_df&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;weight&lt;/code&gt; are called &lt;em&gt;variables&lt;/em&gt; because they have been assigned a bunch of stuff which in this case are integers. Well we have these, might as well do something with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;height &amp;lt;- c(145, 167, 176, 123, 150)

&lt;p&gt;Well that wasn’t exciting at all was it? It’ll get interesting soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R provides many functions to examine features of vectors and other objects, for example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;class()&lt;/code&gt; - what kind of object is it (high-level)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;typeof()&lt;/code&gt; - what is the object’s data type (low-level)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;length()&lt;/code&gt; - how long is it? What about two dimensional objects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;attributes()&lt;/code&gt; - does it have any metadata? (underlying set of data that describes and gives information about other data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class(weight) # Yup there are numbers so numeric makes sense.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;numeric&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;typeof(weight) # You see the term &amp;#39;double&amp;#39; here but you may also see &amp;#39;single&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;integer&amp;#39;. All this refers to is the precision of the number and you can assume they are all integers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;double&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;length(weight) # There are 5 objects in weight so length(weight) = 5 makes sense.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;attributes(weight) # Null since there isn&amp;#39;t any other information except for what you see.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## NULL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;data-frames---a-format-you-absolutely-want&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data Frames - A Format You Absolutely Want&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want all of our data to be in this form. A &lt;em&gt;data frame&lt;/em&gt; is a table or a two-dimensional array-like structure in which each column contains values of one variable and each row contains one set of values from each column. Characteristics of a data frame are as follows and in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The column names should be non-empty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The row names should be unique.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data stored in a data frame can be of numeric, factor or character type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each column should contain same number of data items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: You can always check if a variable is a data frame by &lt;code&gt;is.data.frame(whatever)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;importing-and-viewing-data&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Importing and Viewing Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read in the file &lt;code&gt;USpop2010to2017.csv&lt;/code&gt; that has data on US population estimates from 2010 to 2017. You can do this in multiple ways but for now and since you’re getting used to menu. To bring in the file, go to the &lt;code&gt;Environment&lt;/code&gt; tab in the upper right window and then &lt;code&gt;Import Dataset &amp;gt; From Text (readr) &amp;gt; Browse&lt;/code&gt; to find your file and load it in. Before clicking on the &lt;code&gt;Import&lt;/code&gt; button, name the variable &lt;code&gt;population&lt;/code&gt; under &lt;code&gt;Import options&lt;/code&gt;. You should get an output similar to the one shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But know that we will be moving away from the idea of using a mouse/trackpad to do things because it wastes time and is generally disruptive. Instead we’ll use the file’s &lt;em&gt;relative path&lt;/em&gt;, that is the locations of all other files in comparison to your script to bring in data. If the &lt;code&gt;USpop2010to2017.csv&lt;/code&gt; data set is in the same folder as your script, then run the following command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;population &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;USpop2010to2017.csv&amp;quot;, 
                       header = TRUE, 
                       stringsAsFactors = TRUE) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now take a look at the file by running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;population&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##         Census_ID Collection_year Total_Pop  Male_Pop Female_Pop Estimate

&lt;p&gt;Well that is long and annoying. We can use the &lt;code&gt;head()&lt;/code&gt; command to make it only display six lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(population)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or any number actually&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(population, 4)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##         Census_ID Collection_year Total_Pop  Male_Pop Female_Pop Estimate
## 1 POPESTIMATE2010            2010 309338421 152082993  157255428        N

&lt;p&gt;You can actually look at the entire dataset in a spreadsheet like window by using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;View(population)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about how a data set is made up you can use the command &lt;code&gt;str()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;glimpse()&lt;/code&gt;. This essentially asks R for information about the internal structure of any set of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;str(population)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## &amp;#39;data.frame&amp;#39;:    8 obs. of  6 variables:

&lt;p&gt;This may seem like a mess but it actually tells you a lot. First thing you should notice is that all of the columns are laid out into lines to be “easily” readable but the structure of the data set does not change! Here is some other important things in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have an 8 x 5 matrix (aka a data set with 8 columns and 5 rows)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a data frame with variables given by &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;. More about this below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first column is a character vector (made up only of strings of text).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The remaining columns are integer vectors (made up only of numbers in the form of integers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may be wondering why we skipped over the &lt;code&gt;factors&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;levels&lt;/code&gt;. That’s a bit complicated for this session but we will get to it because they play an important role in visualizing the data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK well that’s better but it looks funny - the y-axis looks like the output on a mid 90s calculator that couldn’t handle exponents. So we’re going to divide and round. Since everything is in hundreds of millions in our data set, let’s divide each column by one hundred million but keep the original figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# We don&amp;#39;t divide anything in census because it just contains the original variables
census &amp;lt;- population$Census_ID 

# We don&amp;#39;t want to divide anything here because this column has data on years
year &amp;lt;- population$Collection_year 

# These are the actual data so that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;ll reduce. 
tinytotal &amp;lt;- population$Total_Pop/100000000 
tinymale &amp;lt;- population$Male_Pop/100000000
tinyfemale &amp;lt;- population$Female_Pop/100000000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that these are proportionally smaller, let’s hope the visuals are more understandable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(year, tinytotal) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks much better but let’s change the axis labels to be more descriptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(year, tinytotal, 
     xlab = &amp;quot;Years&amp;quot;, 
     ylab = &amp;quot;Number of People (in hundreds of millions)&amp;quot;) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s good but the size of the labels should be bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(year, tinytotal, 
     xlab = &amp;quot;Years&amp;quot;, 
     ylab = &amp;quot;Number of People (in hundreds of millions)&amp;quot;, 
     cex.lab = 1.5) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well its bland so how about a little color?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(year, tinytotal, 
     xlab = &amp;quot;Years&amp;quot;, 
     ylab = &amp;quot;Number of People(in hundreds of millions)&amp;quot;, 
     cex.lab = 1.5, 
     col.lab=&amp;quot;#ee4035&amp;quot;, 
     col=&amp;quot;#7bc043&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure but those dots are difficult to see. Let’s make them different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(year, tinytotal, 
     xlab = &amp;quot;Years&amp;quot;, 
     ylab = &amp;quot;Number of People(in hundreds of millions)&amp;quot;, 
     cex.lab = 1.5, 
     col.lab=&amp;quot;#ee4035&amp;quot;,
     col=&amp;quot;#7bc043&amp;quot;, 
     pch = 19)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-41-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No bigger!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(year, tinytotal, 
     xlab = &amp;quot;Years&amp;quot;, 
     ylab = &amp;quot;Number of People (in hundreds of millions)&amp;quot;, 
     cex.lab = 1.5, 
     col.lab=&amp;quot;#ee4035&amp;quot;,
     col=&amp;quot;#7bc043&amp;quot;, 
     pch = 19, 
     cex = 1.5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-42-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said bigger dammit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(year, tinytotal, 
     xlab = &amp;quot;Years&amp;quot;, 
     ylab = &amp;quot;Number of People (in hundreds of millions)&amp;quot;, 
     cex.lab = 1.5, 
     col.lab=&amp;quot;#ee4035&amp;quot;,
     col=&amp;quot;#7bc043&amp;quot;, 
     pch = 19, 
     cex = 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-43-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And without that annoying box&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(year, tinytotal, 
     xlab = &amp;quot;Years&amp;quot;, 
     ylab = &amp;quot;Number of People (in hundreds of millions)&amp;quot;, 
     cex.lab = 1.5, 
     col.lab=&amp;quot;#ee4035&amp;quot;,
     col=&amp;quot;#7bc043&amp;quot;, 
     pch = 19, 
     cex = 2,
     bty = &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-44-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe a colorful title?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(year, tinytotal, 
     xlab = &amp;quot;Years&amp;quot;, 
     ylab = &amp;quot;Number of People (in hundreds of millions)&amp;quot;, 
     cex.lab = 1.5, 
     col.lab=&amp;quot;#ee4035&amp;quot;,
     col=&amp;quot;#7bc043&amp;quot;, 
     pch = 19, 
     cex = 2,
     bty = &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;,
     main = &amp;quot;United States Population Estimates (2010-2017)&amp;quot;, 
     cex.main = 1.5,
     col.main = &amp;quot;#0392cf&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-45-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(year, tinytotal, 
     xlab = &amp;quot;Years&amp;quot;, 
     ylab = &amp;quot;Number of People (in hundreds of millions)&amp;quot;, 
     cex.lab = 1.5, 
     col.lab=&amp;quot;#ee4035&amp;quot;,
     col=&amp;quot;#7bc043&amp;quot;, 
     pch = 19, 
     cex = 2,
     bty = &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;,
     main = &amp;quot;United States Population Estimates (2010-2017)&amp;quot;, 
     cex.main = 1.5,
     col.main = &amp;quot;#0392cf&amp;quot;,
     type = &amp;quot;o&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-46-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No that’s too skinny!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(year, tinytotal, 
     xlab = &amp;quot;Years&amp;quot;, 
     ylab = &amp;quot;Number of People (in hundreds of millions)&amp;quot;, 
     cex.lab = 1.5, 
     col.lab=&amp;quot;#ee4035&amp;quot;,
     col=&amp;quot;#7bc043&amp;quot;, 
     pch = 19, 
     cex = 2,
     bty = &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;,
     main = &amp;quot;United States Population Estimates (2010-2017)&amp;quot;, 
     cex.main = 1.5,
     col.main = &amp;quot;#0392cf&amp;quot;,
     type = &amp;quot;o&amp;quot;,
     lwd = 3.5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-47-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’ll do for now but that is a ton of work and a lot of not so obvious commands to memorize. So what’s the big deal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;a-bit-of-context&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A Bit of Context&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well what you just went through is the &lt;em&gt;OG&lt;/em&gt; R which was released publicly in 1995. While nowadays it is commonly known as &lt;em&gt;Base R&lt;/em&gt;, a majority of its functionality, structure and syntax were derived from another piece of software called S-Plus which was a commercial product from 1988 primarily used only by statisticians. Regardless of the name, this would continue to be the case until the 2007 when &lt;a href=&#34;%22http://hadley.nz/%22&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hadley Wickham&lt;/a&gt; officially released an R add-on, or &lt;em&gt;package&lt;/em&gt; called &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt;. Little did anybody know that this would alter the future of data visualization. Starting next week, we’ll move on from Base R to &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; and its companion packages known as the &lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt;. If you want to get a preview, click on the image below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;width:180px; height:180px&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tidyverse.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/img/logos/tidyverse.png&#34; alt=&#34;Tidyverse Hex&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that’s not to say there isn’t value in knowing Base R. There are many commands that are quick and easy and don’t need add-ons. In fact, some of the syntax has survived the transition to the &lt;em&gt;tidy&lt;/em&gt; format we’ll get to next week so for now, back to Base R!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;basic-visualizations-1&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Basic Visualizations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;histograms&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Histograms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this part, we will use data on the number of users on facebook. Lets read the data into R like so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;facebook &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;ActiveFacebookUsers.csv&amp;quot;, 
                       header = TRUE, 
                       stringsAsFactors = TRUE) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the first six rows and get some information about the columns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(facebook)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##   Quarter Number.of.users.in.millions
## 1  Q3 &amp;#39;08                         100
## 2  Q1 &amp;#39;09                         197
## 3  Q2 &amp;#39;09                         242
## 4  Q3 &amp;#39;09                         305
## 5  Q4 &amp;#39;09                         360
## 6  Q1 &amp;#39;10                         431&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;str(facebook) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## &amp;#39;data.frame&amp;#39;:    39 obs. of  2 variables:
##  $ Quarter                    : chr  &amp;quot;Q3 &amp;#39;08&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q1 &amp;#39;09&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q2 &amp;#39;09&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q3 &amp;#39;09&amp;quot; ...
##  $ Number.of.users.in.millions: int  100 197 242 305 360 431 482 550 608 680 ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Alternatively, you can use glimpse()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;facebook$Quarter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##  [1] &amp;quot;Q3 &amp;#39;08&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q1 &amp;#39;09&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q2 &amp;#39;09&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q3 &amp;#39;09&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q4 &amp;#39;09&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q1 &amp;#39;10&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q2 &amp;#39;10&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q3 &amp;#39;10&amp;quot;
##  [9] &amp;quot;Q4 &amp;#39;10&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q1 &amp;#39;11&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q2 &amp;#39;11&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q3 &amp;#39;11&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q4 &amp;#39;11&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q1 &amp;#39;12&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q2 &amp;#39;12&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q3 &amp;#39;12&amp;quot;
## [17] &amp;quot;Q4 &amp;#39;12&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q1 &amp;#39;13&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q2 &amp;#39;13&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q3 &amp;#39;13&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q4 &amp;#39;13&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q1 &amp;#39;14&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q2 &amp;#39;14&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q3 &amp;#39;14&amp;quot;
## [25] &amp;quot;Q4 &amp;#39;14&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q1 &amp;#39;15&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q2 &amp;#39;15&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q3 &amp;#39;15&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q4 &amp;#39;15&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q1 &amp;#39;16&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q2 &amp;#39;16&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q3 &amp;#39;16&amp;quot;
## [33] &amp;quot;Q4 &amp;#39;16&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q1 &amp;#39;17&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q2 &amp;#39;17&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q3 &amp;#39;17&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q4 &amp;#39;17&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q1 &amp;#39;18&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Q2 &amp;#39;18&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;facebook$Number.of.users.in.millions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##  [1]  100  197  242  305  360  431  482  550  608  680  739  800  845  901  955
## [16] 1007 1056 1110 1155 1189 1228 1276 1317 1350 1393 1441 1490 1545 1591 1654
## [31] 1712 1788 1860 1936 2006 2072 2129 2196 2234&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s rename the columns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;users &amp;lt;- facebook$Number.of.users.in.millions
quarter &amp;lt;- facebook$Quarter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to use the &lt;code&gt;hist()&lt;/code&gt; function to plot a basic histogram of the number of users and quarters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hist(users) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-55-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Hey its a normal distribution!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can specify the number of cells for the histogram using the &lt;code&gt;breaks&lt;/code&gt; option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hist(users,
     breaks = 40) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-56-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essentially breaks up the default way that the histogram is constructed. You can also do it within the range of the data set. First to see the minimum and maximum, we use &lt;code&gt;min()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;min(users) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 100&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;max(users) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 2234&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I wanted to see how this histogram looks say broken into bars of 300, we can do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(max(users) - min(users))/300&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 7.113333&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or better yet if we round up, we’ll get the actual number of bars we need. To always round to the next integer, we can use the &lt;code&gt;ceiling()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ceiling((max(users) - min(users))/300)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can count in 300s and get the output you want&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hist(users, 
     breaks = c(100,400,700,1000,1300,1600,1900,2100,2400))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-61-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but that’s a lot of work and its a bit odd because our data aren’t greater than the the maximum. We can still get the eight bars we want of even width if we let R do it for us using the &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt;, or sequence option with &lt;code&gt;length.out&lt;/code&gt;, or the number of desired bars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hist(users, 
     breaks = seq(min(users), 
                  max(users),  
                  length.out=8))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-62-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s make it look decent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hist(users, breaks = seq(min(users), 
                         max(users),   
                         length.out=8), 
     xlab = &amp;quot;Active Users (in millions)&amp;quot;, 
     main = &amp;quot;Facebook utility worldwide as of 2nd quarter 2018&amp;quot;,
     col = c(&amp;quot;#3b5998&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;#6d84b4&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#afbdd4&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#d8dfea&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#ffffff&amp;quot;), 
     border = &amp;quot;#d8dfea&amp;quot;, 
     cex.lab = 1.1) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-63-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that you can define colors in a vector and the plot will simply repeat that layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;line-graph&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Line Graph&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at another population, but this time we’ll use Twitter data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;twitter &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;ActiveTwitterUsers.csv&amp;quot;, 
                       header = TRUE, 
                       stringsAsFactors = TRUE) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(twitter)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##   Quarter Number.of.monthly.active.users.in.millions
## 1   20101                                         30
## 2   20102                                         40
## 3   20103                                         49
## 4   20104                                         54
## 5   20111                                         68
## 6   20112                                         85&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;str(twitter)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## &amp;#39;data.frame&amp;#39;:    37 obs. of  2 variables:
##  $ Quarter                                   : int  20101 20102 20103 20104 20111 20112 20113 20114 20121 20122 ...
##  $ Number.of.monthly.active.users.in.millions: num  30 40 49 54 68 85 101 117 138 151 ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;twitter$Quarter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##  [1] 20101 20102 20103 20104 20111 20112 20113 20114 20121 20122 20123 20124

## [37] 20191&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;twitter$Number.of.monthly.active.users.in.millions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##  [1]  30.0  40.0  49.0  54.0  68.0  85.0 101.0 117.0 138.0 151.0 167.0 185.0
## [13] 204.0 218.0 231.7 241.0 255.0 271.0 284.0 288.0 302.0 304.0 307.0 305.0

## [37] 330.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s rename the columns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tweeters &amp;lt;- twitter$Number.of.monthly.active.users.in.millions
season &amp;lt;- twitter$Quarter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s first create a basic plot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(season, tweeters)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-71-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several types of plot within the plot function which we can access by using the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(season, tweeters,
     type = &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-72-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now try options “o”, “p”, and “b” on your own. Check the solutions below to see if your plot rendered correctly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Solutions
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(season, tweeters,
     type = &amp;quot;o&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-73-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(season, tweeters,
     type = &amp;quot;p&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-74-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(season, tweeters,
     type = &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-75-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also change the line type using the &lt;code&gt;lty&lt;/code&gt; option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(season, tweeters, 
     type = &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;, 
     lty = &amp;quot;dashed&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-76-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(season, tweeters, 
     type = &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;, 
     lty = &amp;quot;dotted&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-77-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well it looks like the solid line is likely the best so we’ll stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(season, tweeters,
     type = &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-78-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black and white plots can be great but that’s rarely true for data with ore information than two dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(season, tweeters,
     type = &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;,
     col = &amp;quot;#5cb85c&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-79-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use a standard palette in R by using numbers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(season, tweeters,
     type = &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;,
     col = 3)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-80-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That line is just too thin. We can make it thicker by using the &lt;code&gt;lwd&lt;/code&gt; option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(season, tweeters,
     col = &amp;quot;#5cb85c&amp;quot;, 
     lwd = 3)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-81-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can sort out the axes and plot titles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(season, tweeters, 
     type = &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;, 
     col = &amp;quot;#5cb85c&amp;quot;, 
     lwd = 3,
     xlab = &amp;quot;Quarter&amp;quot;,
     ylab = &amp;quot;Tweeters (in millions)&amp;quot;,
     main = &amp;quot;Active Users on Twitter&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-82-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did promise regression didn’t I? OK well what if we wanted to know the answer to the question: &lt;em&gt;is the Twitter population increasing in size?&lt;/em&gt;
Well we can add a basic linear regression to the plot to estimate if that’s true. First let’s calculate the regression line…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fit1 &amp;lt;- lm (tweeters ~ season, 
            data = twitter) 

summary(fit1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(fit1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-83-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-83-2.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-83-3.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-83-4.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;scatterplots&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scatterplots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s load a dataset of Flower characteristics in 3 species of Iris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data(iris)
head(iris)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
## 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
## 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
## 5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of data here! Let’s explore using the &lt;code&gt;pairs()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pairs(iris)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-85-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t tell us much about the species differences. We can tell R to plot using a different color for the three species of iris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pairs(iris, 
      col = iris$Species)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-86-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepal.Length and Petal.Length look interesting! Let’s start by looking at that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(iris$Sepal.Length, 
     iris$Petal.Length, 
     col = iris$Species)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-87-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These points are difficult to see! Let’s pick some different ones using the &lt;code&gt;pch&lt;/code&gt; option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(iris$Sepal.Length, 
     iris$Petal.Length, 
     col = iris$Species, 
     pch = 15)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-88-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(iris$Sepal.Length, 
     iris$Petal.Length, 
     col = iris$Species, 
     pch = &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-89-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pch&lt;/code&gt; 21:25 also specify an edge color (col) and a background color (bg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(iris$Sepal.Length, 
     iris$Petal.Length, 
     col = iris$Species, 
     pch = 21, 
     bg = &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-90-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK settling on solid circles…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(iris$Sepal.Length, 
     iris$Petal.Length, 
     col = iris$Species, 
     pch = 16)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-91-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…that need to be bigger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(iris$Sepal.Length, 
     iris$Petal.Length, 
     col = iris$Species, 
     pch = 16,
     cex = 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-92-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;boxplots&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Boxplots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll continue to use the Iris dataset for this section&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(iris)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
## 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
## 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
## 5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets first examine the distribution of Sepal Length for each species&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;boxplot(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Species)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-94-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f you wish to compare the medians of the boxplot, you can use the function “notch”. If the notches of two plots do not overlap, this is ‘strong evidence’ that the two medians differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;boxplot(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Species, 
        notch = T)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-95-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that the y-axis labels are always orientated to be perpendicular to the axis. We can rotate all axis labels using the &lt;code&gt;las&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;boxplot(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Species, 
        notch = T,
        las = 1) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-96-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can add in all the axis and plot labels…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;boxplot(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Species, 
        notch = T,
        las = 1,
        xlab = &amp;quot;Species&amp;quot;, 
        ylab = &amp;quot;Sepal Length&amp;quot;, 
        main = &amp;quot;Sepal Length by Species in Iris&amp;quot;) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-97-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and change sizes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;boxplot(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Species, 
        notch = T,
        las = 1,
        xlab = &amp;quot;Species&amp;quot;, 
        ylab = &amp;quot;Sepal Length&amp;quot;, 
        main = &amp;quot;Sepal Length by Species in Iris&amp;quot;,
        cex.lab = 1.5,
        cex.axis = 1.5,
        cex.main = 2) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-98-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;plot-options&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Plot Options&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;rendering-more-than-one-plot-in-a-window&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rendering more than one plot in a window&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# number of rows, number of columns
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

plot(
     # x variable, y variable
     iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length, 
     
      # color by species
     col = iris$Species,     
     
     # plot title
     main = &amp;quot;Sepal vs Petal Length in Iris&amp;quot;
     )      

plot(
    # x variable, y variable
     iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length, 
     
      # color by species
     col = iris$Species,     
     
     # plot title
     main = &amp;quot;Sepal vs Petal Length in Iris&amp;quot;
     )        &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-99-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding the following sets the plot window back to normal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;par(mfrow=c(1,1))    

plot(
     # x variable, y variable
     iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length, 
     
      # color by species
     col = iris$Species,     
     
     # plot title
     main = &amp;quot;Sepal vs Petal Length in Iris&amp;quot;
     )   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-100-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or you can just clear the plot history by running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dev.off()       &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## null device 
##           1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;First Things First! Set your Working Directory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;em&gt;working directory&lt;/em&gt; is simply where your script will look for anything it needs like external data sets. There are a few ways to go about doing this which we will cover. However for now, just do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up a new script by going to &lt;code&gt;File &amp;gt; New File &amp;gt; R Script&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save it in a preferably empty folder as whatever you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the menu bar and select &lt;code&gt;Session &amp;gt; Set Working Directory &amp;gt; To Source File Location&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;download-the-script&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download the script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copying and pasting syntax from a browser can cause problems. To avoid this issue, please download a script with all of the needed code presented in this walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll work on this throughout the term, but here is a basic picture of the framework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/ggplot_layers.png&#34; title=&#34;fig:&#34; alt=&#34;layers of ggplot2&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;example-diamonds&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example: Diamonds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll use the &lt;em&gt;diamonds&lt;/em&gt; data set that’s included in &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt;, in particular we’ll start with this plot with a bunch of foundational commands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot() +
  layer(
    data = diamonds, 
    mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price),
    geom = &amp;quot;point&amp;quot;,  
    stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;, 
    position = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot; ) +
  scale_y_continuous() +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  coord_cartesian()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which can be condensed to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = diamonds, 
  mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get &lt;em&gt;lazy&lt;/em&gt; about arguments, in that &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; are always the first arguments to &lt;code&gt;aes&lt;/code&gt; so we often drop the argument names&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

                              35.27131783, 
                              35.46511628,

                              0.00069993)), 
                      .Names = c(&amp;quot;Perc&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Prop&amp;quot;), 
                  row.names = c(NA, 6L), 
                  class = &amp;quot;data.frame&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and view it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;View(data)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above says: I want a structure a list with two columns with variable Names V1 and V2 with the associated values in columns (given by c). Moreover, I want to name those columns &lt;strong&gt;Prop&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Perc&lt;/strong&gt;, with no row names (NA) and of length 6 (6 rows given by 6L). Finally, and possibly most importantly, it has to be a data frame!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s look at a barplot of the data using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Base R&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;barplot(data$Perc, 
        data$Perc, 
        xlab=&amp;quot;Percentage&amp;quot;, 
        ylab=&amp;quot;Proportion&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ggplot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data, aes(x=Perc, y=Prop)) + 
  geom_bar(stat=&amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s try colors by using the &lt;em&gt;Perc&lt;/em&gt; column&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data, aes(x=Perc, y=Prop, fill = Perc)) +

&lt;p&gt;We’ll use the mtcars data set. It is a standard example set that comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we wanted to get the count of vehicles that have 4, 6 and 8 cylinders we can simply identify the &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;-axis variable and apply &lt;code&gt;geom_bar()&lt;/code&gt;. This, by default will plot the count of 4, 6, and 8 cylinder vehicles in the data set. However, note that if the variable is numeric it may be interpreted as a continuous variable. This is the case in the first plot you will do below which is why the x-axis is continuous in nature. However, we can force the cylinder variable to a categorical (factor) variable by applying &lt;code&gt;x = factor(cyl)&lt;/code&gt; using the second plot you will do below which produces a discrete &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# x-axis as continuous
p1 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = cyl)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Fig. A: x-axis as a continuous variable&amp;quot;)

# x-axis as discrete
p2 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Fig B: x-axis as a discrete (factor) variable&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ll see how to deal with the cut off text later&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll display the results in two ways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;gridExtra&lt;/strong&gt; package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;patchwork&lt;/strong&gt; package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p1 + p2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the default width of the bars is aesthetically pleasing, you do have the ability to adjust this attribute by setting the width in &lt;code&gt;geom_bar()&lt;/code&gt;. The default width is 0.9;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;smaller values (min width of 0) make the bars narrower and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;larger values (max width of 1) make the bars wider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar(width = .5) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;bar width = 0.5&amp;quot;)

e2 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar(width = .75) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;bar width = 0.75&amp;quot;)

e3 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar(width = .9) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;bar width = 0.9&amp;quot;)

e4 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar(width = .99) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;bar width = 0.99&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1 + e2 + e3 + e4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1 + e2 + e3 + e4 + plot_layout(ncol = 1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;e1 + e2 + e3 + e4 + plot_layout(nrow = 1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at some more examples over at the &lt;strong&gt;patchwork&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#%20https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/guides/assembly.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;vignette&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also adjust the fill and outline colors of the bars along with the opacity by applying &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; arguments respectively in the &lt;code&gt;geom_bar()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar(fill = &amp;quot;dodgerblue&amp;quot;, 
           color = &amp;quot;grey40&amp;quot;, 
           alpha = 0.5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also times when we want to plot many categories along the x-axis and the length of the names make it difficult to read. One approach to resolving this issue is to use &lt;code&gt;axis.text.x&lt;/code&gt; argument within the &lt;code&gt;theme()&lt;/code&gt; function to rotate the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;t1 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = row.names(mtcars), y = mpg)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Fig. A: Default x-axis&amp;quot;)

t1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;t2 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = row.names(mtcars), y = mpg)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = .5)) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Fig. B: Rotated x-axis&amp;quot;)

t2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-2.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;t1 + t2 + plot_layout(ncol = 1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-3.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you may hate to read rotated x-axis labels since it can be difficult. In cases like these rotated bar charts are far more appealing. We can rotate the axes by applying the &lt;code&gt;coord_flip()&lt;/code&gt; function, which flips the &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; coordinates. To make this even easier to digest we can order the vehicles based on their &lt;em&gt;mpg&lt;/em&gt; values as illustrated in the second plot you’ll do below. To do this just reorder the &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; variable by applying the &lt;code&gt;reorder()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;r1 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = row.names(mtcars), mpg)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Fig. A: Default rotated x-axis&amp;quot;)

# order bars
r2 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = reorder(row.names(mtcars), mpg), y = mpg)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Fig. B: Rotated ordered x-axis&amp;quot;)

r1 + r2 + plot_layout(nrow = 1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;comparisons-using-bar-charts&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comparisons Using Bar Charts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we want to compare different groups across the categorical variables of interest. This is primarily done via color, side-by-side bars, or stacked bars. To add a color dimension we simply add a fill argument to our first line of code to tell R what variable we want to use to color our bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example we compare mpg across all the vehicles but also color the vehicles based on number of cylinders. R will use default color codings but you can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set the colors manually using scale_fill_manual as in the second plot you’ll do. But you can also&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use &lt;code&gt;scale_fill_brewer&lt;/code&gt; to color with preset color schemes (see more about ColorBrewer &lt;a href=&#34;http://colorbrewer2.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many others! (if you type &lt;code&gt;scale_fill&lt;/code&gt; into your RStudio Help search field you will see all the possibilities)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s compare mpg across all cars and color based on cyl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;m1 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = reorder(row.names(mtcars), mpg), y = mpg, fill = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Fig. A: Default fill colors&amp;quot;)

m2 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = reorder(row.names(mtcars), mpg), y = mpg, fill = factor(cyl))) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(&amp;quot;#e5f5e0&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#a1d99b&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#31a354&amp;quot;)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Fig. B: Manually set fill colors&amp;quot;)


m1 + m2 + plot_layout(ncol = 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also use side-by-side bars to make comparisons. Say we want to compare the average mpg for cars across the different 4, 6, and 8 cylinder categories but also assess the impact that transmission (variable am where 0 = automatic, 1 = manual) has. we apply the fill argument to color bars based on transmission type then include the &lt;code&gt;position = &#34;dodge&#34;&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;geom_bar()&lt;/code&gt; function. This tells R to have two bars for each cylinder type, color fill each bar based on the type of transmission and then adjust (aka “dodge”) the position of the bars so that they are side-by-side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;t1 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;, position = &amp;quot;dodge&amp;quot;) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Default color comparison&amp;quot;)

# more pleasing colors
t2 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;, position = &amp;quot;dodge&amp;quot;) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = &amp;quot;Pastel1&amp;quot;) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Adjusted color comparison&amp;quot;)

t1 + t2 + plot_layout(ncol = 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can adjust the dodge width by incorporating the &lt;code&gt;position = position_dodge(width = x)&lt;/code&gt; argument in the &lt;code&gt;geom_bar()&lt;/code&gt; function. By default, the width is 0.90 and a lower value will create overlap of your side-by-side bars and a larger value will create spacing between the bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;l1 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;, position = &amp;quot;dodge&amp;quot;) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Default dodge positioning&amp;quot;) +
  theme(legend.position = &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;)

l2 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;, position = position_dodge(width = .5)) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Overlap of side-by-side bars&amp;quot;) +
  theme(legend.position = &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;)

l3 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;, position = position_dodge(width = 1)) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Spacing between side-by-side bars&amp;quot;) +
  labs(fill = &amp;quot;AM&amp;quot;) +
  theme(legend.position = c(1,1), legend.justification = c(1,1),
        legend.background = element_blank())


l1 + l2 + l3 + plot_layout(ncol = 3)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stacked bars are the third common approach to compare groups with bar charts. By default, when you introduce a variable to color fill with in the first line, if you enter no other arguments ggplot will produce a stacked bar chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the way ggplot color codes the bars is opposite to how the colors are displayed in the legend. We can resolve this two different ways; either reverse the legend with the arguments displayed in the guides() function in your first plotbelow. or specify the direction of the levels when transforming the transmission (am) variable into a factor as displayed in the first line of code in Fig B. Both will align the legend color coding layout to the color coding of the stacked bars but each option also helps determine which color is top versus on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# reverse legend color coding layout
q1 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +

&lt;p&gt;As before we can change the color of our stacked bars by incorporating one of the many &lt;code&gt;scale_fill_xxxx&lt;/code&gt; arguments. Here I manually specify the colors to apply with &lt;code&gt;scale_fill_manual()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, fill = factor(am, levels = c(1, 0)))) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(&amp;quot;#a1d99b&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#31a354&amp;quot;)) +
  labs(fill = &amp;quot;AM&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;adding-values&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding Values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, it is helpful to provide labels/markers on the bar charts to help the reader interpret the results correctly or just to make it easier to read the graphic. For instance, we can add the actual mpg value to the following vertical bar chart by incorporating the &lt;code&gt;geom_text()&lt;/code&gt; function and telling the function to label each bar with the mpg value. I can also tell ggplot to nudge the values left or right sit within or outside the bar and also color the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p1 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(reorder(row.names(mtcars), mpg), mpg)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_text(aes(label = mpg), nudge_y = 2)

p2 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(reorder(row.names(mtcars), mpg), mpg)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_text(aes(label = mpg), nudge_y = -2, color = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;)

p1 + p2 + plot_layout(ncol = 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labeling grouped bars is similar, however, we need to add a &lt;code&gt;position = position_dodge(0.9)&lt;/code&gt; argument to the &lt;code&gt;geom_text()&lt;/code&gt; function to tell ggplot to adjust the text location. By default, the values will be centered on the top of the bar but you can adjust the text to the top of the bar by including a &lt;code&gt;vjust = 0.5&lt;/code&gt; argument or adjust the text to within the bar with &lt;code&gt;vjust = 1.5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p1 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;, position = &amp;quot;dodge&amp;quot;) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(mpg, 1)), position = position_dodge(0.9)) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Fig A: Default text alignment&amp;quot;)

p2 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;, position = &amp;quot;dodge&amp;quot;) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(mpg, 1)), position = position_dodge(0.9),
            vjust = 1.5, color = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Fig B: Adjusted text alignment&amp;quot;)

p1 + p2 + plot_layout(ncol = 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/03-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can change the colors palettes using hex (aka hexidecimal) colors! Take a look here for an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.color-hex.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, we’ll be using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;viridis color set&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p1 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;, position = &amp;quot;dodge&amp;quot;) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(mpg, 1)), position = position_dodge(0.9)) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Fig A: Default text alignment&amp;quot;)

p2 &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;, position = &amp;quot;dodge&amp;quot;) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = &amp;quot;D&amp;quot;) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(mpg, 1)), position = position_dodge(0.9),
            vjust = 1.5, color = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Fig B: Adjusted text alignment&amp;quot;)

p2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Uh oh! Did you see something that said &lt;code&gt;## Error: Discrete value supplied to continuous scale&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error says that we tried to add a continuous scale to discrete values! Well we could use this by either&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Getting rid of the factor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;, position = &amp;quot;dodge&amp;quot;) +

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the plots are different! Your fill and color variables define how the plot will look!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;First Things First! Set your Working Directory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;em&gt;working directory&lt;/em&gt; is simply where your script will look for anything it needs like external data sets. There are a few ways to go about doing this which we will cover. However for now, just do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up a new script by going to &lt;code&gt;File &amp;gt; New File &amp;gt; R Script&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save it in a preferably empty folder as whatever you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the menu bar and select &lt;code&gt;Session &amp;gt; Set Working Directory &amp;gt; To Source File Location&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;download-the-script&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download the script&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;load-up-some-libraries&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Load Up Some Libraries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please go ahead and download the libraries below you don’t have and load them up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggtext)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;using-themes-in-ggwhatever&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Using Themes in ggwhatever&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the nice aspects of &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; is in the fact that you can edit most of the aesthetics. While &lt;code&gt;aes()&lt;/code&gt; let’s you define where those aesthetics lie and the &lt;code&gt;scale&lt;/code&gt; family of commands allows for coloring and how the data is represented, how a plot is displayed is found by &lt;code&gt;theme&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do this either manually or using a &lt;em&gt;prepackaged&lt;/em&gt; approach where theme options are already defined. In certain situations you can even use both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;cleaning-and-inspecting-data&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cleaning and Inspecting Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s use a cleaned version of the income data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;income_data &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;income.csv&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## cols(
##   Location = col_character(),
##   Lower_2000 = col_double(),
##   Middle_2000 = col_double(),
##   Upper_2000 = col_double(),
##   Lower_2014 = col_double(),
##   Middle_2014 = col_double(),
##   Upper_2014 = col_double()
## )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;always-inspect-your-data&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Always Inspect your Data!&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can inspect the column names using the &lt;code&gt;names()&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;names(income_data)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;Location&amp;quot;    &amp;quot;Lower_2000&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Middle_2000&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Upper_2000&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Lower_2014&amp;quot; 
## [6] &amp;quot;Middle_2014&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Upper_2014&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and what type they are using &lt;code&gt;str()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;glimpse()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;glimpse(income_data)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Rows: 229

&lt;p&gt;Well 229 rows is a ton of data and a bar plot would look terrible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(income_data, aes(x = Location,

&lt;p&gt;For simplicity sakes, let’s try just looking at the top 10 &lt;em&gt;highest values&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;Lower_2000&lt;/strong&gt; column using &lt;code&gt;slice_max()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;not_top10_income_data &amp;lt;- income_data %&amp;gt;%
                         select(Location, Lower_2000) %&amp;gt;%
                         slice_max(Lower_2000, n = 10); not_top10_income_data&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 10 x 2
##    Location                     Lower_2000
##    &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;                             &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now please note that this is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; equivalent to another function we’ve gone over: &lt;code&gt;head()&lt;/code&gt; which would only return the top 10 &lt;em&gt;rows&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the top 10 &lt;em&gt;highest values&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;top10_income_data &amp;lt;- income_data %&amp;gt;%
                     select(Location, Lower_2000) %&amp;gt;%
                     head(10); top10_income_data&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 10 x 2

## 10 Atlantic City-Hammonton, NJ             29.3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s plot the wrangled data set&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(top10_income_data, aes(x = Location, 
                              y = Lower_2000, 
                              fill = Lower_2000)) +
       geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
       xlab(&amp;quot;Top 10 Cities and States&amp;quot;) +
       ylab(&amp;quot;Average Income in 2000 Lower Class&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/04-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looks good but it could be better. Recall with a &lt;code&gt;scale&lt;/code&gt; command you can color the bars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(top10_income_data, aes(x = Location, 
                              y = Lower_2000, 
                              fill = Lower_2000)) +
       geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
       scale_fill_viridis_c() +
       xlab(&amp;quot;Top 10 Cities and States&amp;quot;) +
       ylab(&amp;quot;Average Income in 2000 Lower Class&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/04-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well the colors are arguably better, though there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html&#34;&gt;other palettes&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;code&gt;viridis&lt;/code&gt; package provides. We can also reorder the bars from greatest to least or vice versa using the &lt;code&gt;reorder()&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;tabs&#34;&gt;
&lt;input name=&#34;tabs&#34; type=&#34;radio&#34; id=&#34;tab-1&#34; class=&#34;input&#34;/&gt;
&lt;label for=&#34;tab-1&#34; class=&#34;label&#34;&gt;Bars from Greatest to Least&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;panel&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(top10_income_data, aes(x = reorder(Location, -Lower_2000),
                              y = Lower_2000, 
                              fill = Lower_2000)) +
       geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
       scale_fill_viridis_c() +
       xlab(&amp;quot;Top 10 Cities and States&amp;quot;) +
       ylab(&amp;quot;Average Income in 2000 Lower Class&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/04-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;input name=&#34;tabs&#34; type=&#34;radio&#34; id=&#34;tab-2&#34; class=&#34;input&#34;/&gt;
&lt;label for=&#34;tab-2&#34; class=&#34;label&#34;&gt;Bars from Least to Greatest&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;panel&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(top10_income_data, aes(x = reorder(Location, Lower_2000),
                              y = Lower_2000, 
                              fill = Lower_2000)) +
       geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
       scale_fill_viridis_c() +
       xlab(&amp;quot;Top 10 Cities and States&amp;quot;) +
       ylab(&amp;quot;Average Income in 2000 Lower Class&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/04-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that’s great but with the grey background, overlapping text on the axis, etc., its certainly not really presentation worthy. Luckily we can use the &lt;code&gt;theme()&lt;/code&gt; option to edit it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;manual-approach&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Manual Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like controlling every little aspect of an experience, then you may be a &lt;em&gt;ggplot control freak&lt;/em&gt; and the manual approach is perfect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a feel for what options you have, try running the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;?theme&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scroll down to &lt;strong&gt;Usage&lt;/strong&gt; to see the commands and &lt;strong&gt;Arguments&lt;/strong&gt; to see a description of each. If you don’t like the tiny Help window or find it convoluted, try giving the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt; Reference&lt;/a&gt; site a look. It has some additional examples as well, though they may or may not be helpful depending on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following, we’ll use the descending data set and &lt;code&gt;themes()&lt;/code&gt; to fix it up a bit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(top10_income_data, aes(x = reorder(Location, -Lower_2000),
                              y = Lower_2000, 
                              fill = Lower_2000)) +
       geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
       scale_fill_viridis_c() +
       theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 33,
                                        face = &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;,
                                        vjust = 0.5),
             axis.title = element_text(size = 14,
                                       face = &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;),
             legend.position = &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;,
             legend.direction = &amp;quot;vertical&amp;quot;,
             panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
             panel.grid.minor.y = element_line(),
             panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
             panel.grid.major.y = element_line()) +
       xlab(&amp;quot;Top 10 Cities and States&amp;quot;) +
       ylab(&amp;quot;Average Income in 2000 Lower Class&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/04-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that’s slightly better but its certainly flawed. For example, it is not immediately clear which values on the &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;-axis goes where. We can do a lot more and we’ll get to it in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to have more of a drag and drop experience while learning themes in &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt;, consider downloading and running the package &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dreamRs/esquisse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;esquisse&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;prepackaged-approach&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prepackaged&lt;/em&gt; Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you fine with having someone else mostly control an experience allowing you to tinker here and there, then you may be a &lt;em&gt;ggplot doodler&lt;/em&gt; and the prepackaged approach is likely a great fit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be that you don’t like the default &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; output but would rather not go through the process of editing every little thing. In these cases you can use &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;predefined themes within &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggthemes&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;, though there are others. You can see how the the original &lt;code&gt;top10_income_data&lt;/code&gt; set looks with these themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;default-in-ggplot2&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are great with controlling when needed and allowing others to control an experience, then the traditional path of least resistance outlook on ggplot will do just fine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can in many circumstances combine manual and &lt;em&gt;prepackaged&lt;/em&gt; themes together. The extent to which you can do this often varies by theme. In any case, let’s see the &lt;code&gt;fivethirtyeight&lt;/code&gt; theme with some manual edits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(top10_income_data, aes(x = reorder(Location, -Lower_2000),
                              y = Lower_2000, 
                              fill = Lower_2000)) +

                                        vjust = 0.5),
             legend.position = &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;,

&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes opening up the data set and viewing a corresponding codebook if available.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you’ve likely heard it before many many many times, it is generally unethical, not to mention statistically destructive to throw out any data without using proper methodology and reasoning&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;or you can use &lt;code&gt;slice_min()&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;lowest values&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn4&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can actually do this in many ways. This particular method is called the &lt;code&gt;data.table&lt;/code&gt; approach.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn5&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some reason&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;First Things First! Set your Working Directory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;em&gt;working directory&lt;/em&gt; is simply where your script will look for anything it needs like external data sets. There are a few ways to go about doing this which we will cover. However for now, just do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up a new script by going to &lt;code&gt;File &amp;gt; New File &amp;gt; R Script&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save it in a preferably empty folder as whatever you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the menu bar and select &lt;code&gt;Session &amp;gt; Set Working Directory &amp;gt; To Source File Location&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;download-the-script&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download the script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copying and pasting syntax from a browser can cause problems. To avoid this issue, please download a script with all of the needed code presented in this walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Part 1: More ggplotting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenario: Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK so you probably know the answer but let’s make the justification as precise as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; data frame found in &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt;.
The data frame contains observations collected by the US Environment Protection Agency on 38 car models. To see all of the unique values, we can run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;unique(mpg$manufacturer)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##  [1] &amp;quot;audi&amp;quot;       &amp;quot;chevrolet&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;dodge&amp;quot;      &amp;quot;ford&amp;quot;       &amp;quot;honda&amp;quot;     
##  [6] &amp;quot;hyundai&amp;quot;    &amp;quot;jeep&amp;quot;       &amp;quot;land rover&amp;quot; &amp;quot;lincoln&amp;quot;    &amp;quot;mercury&amp;quot;   
## [11] &amp;quot;nissan&amp;quot;     &amp;quot;pontiac&amp;quot;    &amp;quot;subaru&amp;quot;     &amp;quot;toyota&amp;quot;     &amp;quot;volkswagen&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is equivalent to the following as a &lt;code&gt;tibble&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpg %&amp;gt;%
  select(manufacturer) %&amp;gt;%
  distinct()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 15 x 1
##    manufacturer
##    &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;       
##  1 audi

##  3 dodge

&lt;p&gt;We can use &lt;code&gt;glimpse&lt;/code&gt; to see more about each variable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;getting-counts&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting counts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use a quick(ish) plot of the manufacturers and how many of each is represented in the data set&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(mpg, aes(x = manufacturer, fill = manufacturer)) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(stat = &amp;#39;count&amp;#39;, 
             aes(label = after_stat(count)), 
             vjust = -0.5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, 
                                   vjust = 1.3,
                                   hjust = 1)) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/05-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but sometimes its just easier to use &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpg %&amp;gt;%
  select(manufacturer) %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(manufacturer) %&amp;gt;%
  tally() %&amp;gt;%
  ungroup()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 15 x 2
##    manufacturer     n
##  * &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;
##  1 audi            18
##  2 chevrolet       19
##  3 dodge           37
##  4 ford            25
##  5 honda            9
##  6 hyundai         14
##  7 jeep             8
##  8 land rover       4
##  9 lincoln          3
## 10 mercury          4
## 11 nissan          13
## 12 pontiac          5
## 13 subaru          14
## 14 toyota          34
## 15 volkswagen      27&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is basically saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get the `mpg` tibble %&amp;gt;%
  Only show me the column `manufacturer` %&amp;gt;%
   Perform any wrangling by car manufacturer %&amp;gt;%
   Count by car manufacturer %&amp;gt;%
   Dont do any more wrangling by car manufacturer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step is somewhat important. R remembers certain things and grouping is one of them so its a good idea to &lt;code&gt;ungroup()&lt;/code&gt; columns unless you know that is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what would happen if we didn’t group? Well let’s see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpg %&amp;gt;%
  select(manufacturer) %&amp;gt;%
  tally() &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 1 x 1
##       n
##   &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;
## 1   234&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just gave us a full count of all cars. So grouping is a lifesaver if you want to perform any operations by the values in a column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;displ&lt;/code&gt;: a car’s engine size in liters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hwy&lt;/code&gt;: a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all cases, a car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;exploring-the-data&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exploring the Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the variables &lt;code&gt;displ&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hwy&lt;/code&gt; and try to use them in plots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/05-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happened here? Well we simply put &lt;code&gt;displ&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;-axis and hwy on the &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;-axis to compare them using points. The plot shows a negative relationship between engine size (displ) and fuel efficiency (hwy). In other words, cars with big engines use more fuel. Does this confirm or refute the hypothesis about fuel efficiency and engine size?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Part 1 Questions for You to Turn In&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg)&lt;/code&gt;. What do you see and why is it that way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the drv variable describe?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a scatterplot of &lt;code&gt;hwy&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;cyl.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if you make a scatterplot of &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;drv&lt;/code&gt;? Is the plot useful? Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;part-2-aesthetics&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Part 2: Aesthetics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aesthetics are more than just coloring a plot, you can define directions, shapes, sizes, types, and provide a useful way to bring in a third variable into a static two dimensional image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how is this done? Well in a nutshell you can add a third variable to a two dimensional scatterplot by mapping it to an aesthetic. Recall that an &lt;strong&gt;aesthetic&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;visual property of the objects in your plot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can convey information about your data by mapping the aesthetics in your plot to the variables in your dataset. For example, you can map the colors of your points to the class variable to reveal the class of each car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/05-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;or if you like British English, &lt;code&gt;colour&lt;/code&gt; can be used interchangeably&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, to map an aesthetic to a variable, associate the name of the aesthetic to the name of the variable inside &lt;code&gt;aes()&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt; will automatically assign a unique level of the aesthetic - here a unique color - to each unique value of the variable, a process known as scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt; will also add a legend that explains which levels correspond to which values but you can turn that off as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, we mapped class to the color aesthetic, and though pretty&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that may not be the best method since the graphic is a bit hard to decipher immediately. Instead, we could have mapped class to the size aesthetic in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class)) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: Using size for a discrete variable is not advised.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/05-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s up with the warning? In this case, the exact size of each point would reveal its class affiliation. So the warning is telling us that mapping an unordered variable (&lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;) to an ordered aesthetic (&lt;em&gt;size&lt;/em&gt;) is not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically you are trying to plot a categorical variable - the manufacturers of cars - against a continuous variable - a vehicle’s fuel efficiency on the highway - and its telling you that you probably shouldn’t do that&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok well let’s try something else to distinguish the types of vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the &lt;em&gt;alpha&lt;/em&gt; level better known as &lt;strong&gt;transparency&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;how much of the color can you see through&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: Using alpha for a discrete variable is not advised.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/05-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No? Maybe the shape then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: The shape palette can deal with a maximum of 6 discrete values because
## more than 6 becomes difficult to discriminate; you have 7. Consider
## specifying shapes manually if you must have them.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: Removed 62 rows containing missing values (geom_point).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/05-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh oh. Something is missing from the plot! So what happened to the SUVs? &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt; will only use &lt;em&gt;six shapes&lt;/em&gt; at a time. By default, additional groups will go unplotted when you use the shape aesthetic so remember this and you’ll save yourself from throwing a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a controlling person, you can also set the aesthetic properties of your geom manually. For example, we can make all of the points in our plot blue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/05-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or even &lt;a href=&#34;https://universityrelations.wvu.edu/brand-guide/color&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;WVU Blue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = &amp;quot;#002855&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/05-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;part-2-questions-for-you-to-turn-in&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part 2 Questions for You to Turn In&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, 
                           color = &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are the points not blue? What has gone wrong with this code and what is it actually doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which variables in &lt;code&gt;mpg&lt;/code&gt; are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;categorical?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuous?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Map a continuous variable to &lt;em&gt;color&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;size&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;shape.&lt;/em&gt; How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Briefly describe happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: you could use &lt;code&gt;?geom_point&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like &lt;code&gt;aes(colour = displ &amp;lt; 5)&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;part-3-grouping&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Part 3: Grouping&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’d like to use multiple colors. Let try something fun based off of this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/65496&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;palette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), 
             color = c(&amp;quot;#34738f&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#122f3d&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#be3e2b&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#ed8a45&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#f6de6c&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh oh. That didn’t work. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well to &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; there are 234 different data points and it doesn’t know how you want that color palette distributed. By the power of mathematics, 5 &amp;lt; 234 so you get an error. To fix it, you either assign 1 color to every data point or 234 different colors. Neither of these sound great. So what can we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well we can group by category. That may help. If you run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpg$class&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that doesn’t help you much in figuring out the types of vehicles we have (yes we did find it before by plotting but assume we hadn’t). Unless you like to clean this type of mess, we simply want to find the unique values and moreover, for coloring purposes, how many we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again to find a list of unique values, we can run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;unique(mpg$class)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;    &amp;quot;midsize&amp;quot;    &amp;quot;suv&amp;quot;        &amp;quot;2seater&amp;quot;    &amp;quot;minivan&amp;quot;   
## [6] &amp;quot;pickup&amp;quot;     &amp;quot;subcompact&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that’s better but I’m lazy and don’t want to count so let’s find the number of unique values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;length(unique(mpg$class))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh good! There are 7 so that implies when we plot by class (type of vehicle), we need to have seven colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/05-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which we did earlier. But to fill it with what we want, we need to override the default colors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, 
                           color = class)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(&amp;quot;#490A3D&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#BD1550&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#E97F02&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#F8CA00&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#8A9B0F&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#95C7D8&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#FFBFF5&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/05-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that since the class variable (type of vehicle) is discrete, we can use &lt;code&gt;scale_color_manual()&lt;/code&gt;. Other discrete scales in ggplot can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_manual.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous variables use other scales and you can fins more about that and other scales can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-scales&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now those dots are pretty small. Let’s make them bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class), size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(&amp;quot;#490A3D&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#BD1550&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#E97F02&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#F8CA00&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#8A9B0F&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#95C7D8&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#FFBFF5&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/05-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That does look better but why is the size now within the geom_point aesthetic? If you don’t know, that’s ok! We’ll
get to that later but for now, think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;note&#34; class=&#34;section level5&#34;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;NOTE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re writing code so you will get errors! But one common problem when creating ggplot2 graphics is to put the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; in the wrong place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has to come at the end of the line, not the start. In other words, make sure you haven’t accidentally written code like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) 
+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re still stuck, try the help. You can get help about any R function by running &lt;code&gt;?function_name&lt;/code&gt; in the console, or selecting the function name and pressing F1 in RStudio. Don’t worry if the help doesn’t seem that helpful - instead skip down to the examples and look for examples that may match what you’re trying to do. For the aesthetics, run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;?aes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;part-4-facets&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Part 4: Facets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to add additional variables is with aesthetics. Another way, particularly useful for categorical variables, is to split your plot into facets, subplots that each display one subset of the data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facet your plot by a single variable, you can use &lt;code&gt;facet_wrap()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;facet_grid()&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s fow now just concentrate on wrapping the data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first argument of &lt;code&gt;facet_wrap()&lt;/code&gt; should be a formula, which you create with &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; followed by a variable name - here “formula” is the name of a data structure in R, not a synonym for an “equation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variable that you pass to &lt;code&gt;facet_wrap()&lt;/code&gt; should be discrete so it can essentially be split apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class), size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(&amp;quot;#490A3D&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#BD1550&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#E97F02&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#F8CA00&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#8A9B0F&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#95C7D8&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#FFBFF5&amp;quot;)) +
 facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/05-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facet your plot on the combination of two variables, use &lt;code&gt;facet_grid()&lt;/code&gt; to your plot The first argument
of this is also a formula. This time the formula should contain two variable names separated by a &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class), size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(&amp;quot;#490A3D&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#BD1550&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#E97F02&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#F8CA00&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#8A9B0F&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#95C7D8&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#FFBFF5&amp;quot;)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/05-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer to not facet particular rows or columns, you can just use a &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; instead of a variable name to imply the entire data set&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class), size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(&amp;quot;#490A3D&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#BD1550&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#E97F02&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#F8CA00&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#8A9B0F&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#95C7D8&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#FFBFF5&amp;quot;)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/05-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;part-4-questions-for-you-to-turn-in&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part 4 Questions for You to Turn In&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do the empty cells in plot with &lt;code&gt;facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)&lt;/code&gt; mean? How do they relate to this plot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What plots does the following code make? What does . do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plot 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plot 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the faceted plot below and compare it to the one with color you did earlier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the color aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;code&gt;?facet_wrap&lt;/code&gt;. What does &lt;code&gt;nrow&lt;/code&gt; do? What does &lt;code&gt;ncol&lt;/code&gt; do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn’t &lt;code&gt;facet_grid()&lt;/code&gt; have &lt;code&gt;nrow&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ncol&lt;/code&gt; arguments (aka options)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When using &lt;code&gt;facet_grid()&lt;/code&gt; you should usually put the variable with more unique levels in the columns. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take some time to change the values in the &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; to see how it changes.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;but never say never!&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, choropleth comes from the Greek &lt;em&gt;choros&lt;/em&gt; (area) and &lt;em&gt;pleth&lt;/em&gt; (value). They distribute colors the map regions based on the measure which then allows for comparisons using the relative value associated with each color of one region to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;preliminary-items&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Preliminary Items&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;first-things-first-set-your-working-directory&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First Things First! Set your Working Directory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;em&gt;working directory&lt;/em&gt; is simply where your script will look for anything it needs like external data sets. There are a few ways to go about doing this which we will cover. However for now, just do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up a new script by going to &lt;code&gt;File &amp;gt; New File &amp;gt; R Script&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save it in a preferably empty folder as whatever you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the menu bar and select &lt;code&gt;Session &amp;gt; Set Working Directory &amp;gt; To Source File Location&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;download-the-script&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download the script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copying and pasting syntax from a browser can cause problems. To avoid this issue, please download a script with all of the needed code presented in this walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;loading-libraries&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loading libraries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and load these or install and then load them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)

&lt;div id=&#34;setting-up-your-api&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting up your API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, you will utilize the Census API. You’ll likely receive a prompt to save it using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;To install your API key for use in future sessions, run this function with install = TRUE.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest rerunning the command and do just that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Input your Census key
census_api_key(&amp;quot;YOUR CENSUS API KEY&amp;quot;)

# Reload the .Renviron marker

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;walkthrough&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Walkthrough&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major functions implemented in &lt;code&gt;tidycensus::get_decennial()&lt;/code&gt;, which grants access to the 1990, 2000, and 2010 decennial US Census APIs, and &lt;code&gt;get_acs&lt;/code&gt;, which grants access to the 5-year American Community Survey APIs. While limited in comparison to the other method we used, what it lacks in breadth, it soon makes up in depth which we will see soon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting variables from the Census or ACS requires knowing the variable ID - and there are thousands of these IDs across the different Census files. To search for variables without pulling your hair out, use the &lt;code&gt;load_variables&lt;/code&gt; function. The function takes two required arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the year of the Census or endyear of the ACS sample, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the dataset - one of &lt;code&gt;sf1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sf3&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;acs5&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ideal functionality, it is recommended that you assign the result of this function to a variable, setting &lt;code&gt;cache = TRUE&lt;/code&gt; to store the result on your computer for future access, and using the &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt; function in RStudio to interactively browse for variables. However, this is not required. However, as an example, we will take the 2016 American Community Survey data set and save it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;acs16 &amp;lt;- load_variables(2016, &amp;quot;acs5&amp;quot;, cache = TRUE) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(acs16) # or View(acs16) if you prefer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##   name       label                           concept                            
##   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;                           &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;                              
## 1 B00001_001 Estimate!!Total                 UNWEIGHTED SAMPLE COUNT OF THE POP…

## 3 B01001_001 Estimate!!Total                 SEX BY AGE                         
## 4 B01001_002 Estimate!!Total!!Male           SEX BY AGE                         
## 5 B01001_003 Estimate!!Total!!Male!!Under 5… SEX BY AGE                         
## 6 B01001_004 Estimate!!Total!!Male!!5 to 9 … SEX BY AGE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this basic example, let’s look at US income by county using the data set &lt;code&gt;B19013_001&lt;/code&gt; (such a clear and obvious name)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;title &amp;lt;- acs16 %&amp;gt;% # use the acs_16 data set we created
  filter(name == &amp;quot;B19013_001&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% # filter everything else out except where we find B19013_001
  select(concept) # select the column concept that provides a very brief description

# Convert to title case. We have to go in a funny way simply due to the encoding of text within the Census API
title &amp;lt;- tolower(title) %&amp;gt;%
          toTitleCase()

title&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;Median Household Income in the Past 12 Months (in 2016 Inflation-Adjusted Dollars)&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then let’s get some income level data from that set…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;us_county_income &amp;lt;-  get_acs(geography = &amp;quot;county&amp;quot;, 
          variables = &amp;quot;B19013_001&amp;quot;, 
          shift_geo = TRUE, 
          geometry = TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Getting data from the 2015-2019 5-year ACS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Using feature geometry obtained from the albersusa package&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Please note: Alaska and Hawaii are being shifted and are not to scale.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and plot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(us_county_income) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = estimate), color = NA) + 
  # Removes the graticule lines from the plot
  coord_sf(datum = NA) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_fill_viridis()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks good. ow let’s get some West Virginia population data like we did earlier in the term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wv_pop &amp;lt;- get_acs(geography = &amp;quot;county&amp;quot;, 
                     variables = &amp;quot;B01003_001&amp;quot;, 
                     state = &amp;quot;WV&amp;quot;,
                     geometry = TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Getting data from the 2015-2019 5-year ACS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Downloading feature geometry from the Census website.  To cache shapefiles for use in future sessions, set `options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)`.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we haven’t done anything out of left field, in that it the process and results are pretty similar to what came before. It is at this point you should note that there is something much more interesting coming. Let’s redo the plot above using a very cool package called &lt;code&gt;leaflet&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s lod (or install and load) some new libraries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(leaflet) # a JavaScript library for interactive maps
library(stringr) # Well I lied...this isn&amp;#39;t new!
library(sf) # A very nice package that allows us to us a standardized way to encode spatial vector data, aka spatial objects.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Linking to GEOS 3.8.1, GDAL 3.1.4, PROJ 6.3.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cheated a little and know how many colors we’ll need (10). Below is one of many ways to construct a continuous scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pal &amp;lt;- colorQuantile(palette = &amp;quot;viridis&amp;quot;, domain = wv_pop$estimate, n = 10)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it gets interesting (well for me anyways…yes I find maps fun). Below we’re going to construct an interactive plot. You can click on the individual counties to see their names:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wv_pop %&amp;gt;%
  st_transform(crs = &amp;quot;+init=epsg:4326&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  leaflet(width = &amp;quot;100%&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  addProviderTiles(provider = &amp;quot;CartoDB.Positron&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  addPolygons(popup = ~ str_extract(NAME, &amp;quot;^([^,]*)&amp;quot;),
              stroke = FALSE,
              smoothFactor = 0,
              fillOpacity = 0.7,
              color = ~ pal(estimate)) %&amp;gt;%
  addLegend(&amp;quot;bottomright&amp;quot;, 
            pal = pal, 
            values = ~ estimate,
            title = &amp;quot;Population percentiles&amp;quot;,
            opacity = 1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning in CPL_crs_from_input(x): GDAL Message 1: +init=epsg:XXXX syntax is
## deprecated. It might return a CRS with a non-EPSG compliant axis order.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Note about geographic information system (GIS)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the heck is &lt;code&gt;st_transform(crs = &#34;+init=epsg:4326&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;? Well without getting too into GIS because that is an entire semesters worth of material in itself, the &lt;code&gt;epsg&lt;/code&gt; part specifically refers to an optimal coordinate system first developed by the European Petroleum Survey Group, an organization involved in best practices for surveying and applied geodesy. The EPSG was absorbed into the International Association of Oil &amp;amp; Gas Producers in 2005 but the code &lt;code&gt;epsg&lt;/code&gt; has become a standard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about GIS in general, let me know as I am considering teaching a section. Again, maps are fun! Inn the meantime, to know more about GIS in general, consider checking out the ersi homepage: &lt;a href=&#34;%22https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview%22&#34;&gt;https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview&lt;/a&gt;. They make the most popular software package for GIS called ArcGIS and thought it is expensive (and I mean expensive) in the outside world, much like Tableau, it is free for students and educators alike. Moreover, companies and organizations that use ArcGIS use it heavily and are more likely than not well aware of the investment. Moreover, mapping geometries (and by this I mean anything from GPS to LiDAR to measuring distances on your phone and more) is a lucrative area to be in. Take a look at this recent report by National Geographic on how wrong we were about the size and population of the Mayan people which absolutely blew my mind: &lt;a href=&#34;%22https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/maya-laser-lidar-guatemala-pacunam/%22&#34;&gt;https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/maya-laser-lidar-guatemala-pacunam/&lt;/a&gt;. That is simply one amazing facet of GIS!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK what were we doing? Oh yeah. OK back to our maps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s now look at one of our border states - Pennsylvania. In this case, we are going to use data regarding Pennsylvania’s population by county and proportional estimates by pulling from the ACS data set &lt;code&gt;B01003_001&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Use the acs_16 data set we created
acs16 %&amp;gt;% 
  # filter everything else out except where we find B01003_001
  filter(name == &amp;quot;B01003_001&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  # select the column concept that provides a very brief description
  select(concept) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 1 x 1
##   concept         
##   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;           
## 1 TOTAL POPULATION&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Pretty much the exact same pull we did above...
pa_pop &amp;lt;- get_acs(geography = &amp;quot;county&amp;quot;, 
                    variables = &amp;quot;B01003_001&amp;quot;, 
                    state = &amp;quot;PA&amp;quot;,
                    geometry = TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Getting data from the 2015-2019 5-year ACS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Downloading feature geometry from the Census website.  To cache shapefiles for use in future sessions, set `options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)`.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# ... but this time we&amp;#39;ll color it differently.
pal &amp;lt;- colorNumeric(palette = &amp;quot;plasma&amp;quot;, 
                    domain = pa_pop$estimate)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# GIS things. Look at the code. Most of it is repetitive and for the most part, I think you should be able to figure out what&amp;#39;s generally going on.

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a deeper exploration of mapping with a purpose. In this case, we are going to map the results of the 2016 Presidential Election. For a look at the maps we are going to do, take a look at this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/business/states-most-threatened-by-trade/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Washington Post article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;preliminary-items&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Preliminary Items&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;first-things-first-download-the-script-and-data-set&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First Things First! Download the script and data set&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please download all of the materials needed for this walkthrough and put them all in a folder by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/Week7materials.zip&#34;&gt;Week 7 materials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;set-your-working-directory&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Set your Working Directory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;em&gt;working directory&lt;/em&gt; is simply where your script will look for anything it needs like external data sets. There are a few ways to go about doing this which we will cover. However for now, just do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up the included script by going to &lt;code&gt;File &amp;gt; Open File&lt;/code&gt; or double click the file itself if RStudio is your default program for opening &lt;code&gt;.R&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To set your working directory:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the menu bar and select &lt;code&gt;Session &amp;gt; Set Working Directory &amp;gt; To Source File Location&lt;/code&gt; OR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run &lt;code&gt;setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;loading-libraries&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loading libraries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and load these or install and then load them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork) 
library(RColorBrewer) 
library(scales)
library(ggpubr)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should first take a look at the new ones being used here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;loading-files&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loading files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll be using a R data file which for historical reasons either ends with &lt;code&gt;.rdata&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.rda&lt;/code&gt;. The nice aspect of using this format in lieu of a regular data set is that objects and full global environments can be saved. Generally this ensures that you or someone else is able to pick up in a screen exactly as it was before with all of the packages, variables, etc. ready to go. Think of it as a snapshot of exactly what an RStudio session looked like when it was saved as the data file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid any conflicts, let’s empty and refresh your &lt;code&gt;Global Environment&lt;/code&gt; which you can access by clicking the &lt;code&gt;Environment&lt;/code&gt; tab in the top window on the right. Now if there is something in there you absolutely need and cannot get back, then skip this step. If not, please clean it out using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rm(list = ls())&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll be using the file &lt;code&gt;election2016.Rdata&lt;/code&gt;. To load it up, run the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;load(election2016.RData)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that does not work, go to the actual data set, right click and open it with RStudio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again if you have familiarity with the structure of your directory, then use the appropriate path. Notice that you don’t have to say something like &lt;code&gt;variable &amp;lt;- load(&#34;/data/election2016.RData&#34;)&lt;/code&gt; because you aren’t just loading up a data set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;left-field-reminder-to-save-your-api-key&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Left field reminder to save your API key&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will not be using the Census API this time around but please save your key for future data pulls. You’ll likely receive a prompt to save it using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Input your Census key generally

# Input your Census key for the tidycensus package
# Load the library
library(tidycensus)

# Save you
census_api_key(&amp;quot;YOUR CENSUS API KEY&amp;quot;, install = TRUE)

# Reload the .Renviron marker
readRenviron(&amp;quot;~/.Renviron&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;walkthrough&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Walkthrough&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;notes&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very first thing to mention here is that the states of Maine and Nebraska split electoral college votes. In 2016, Trump took all 5 of Nebraska’s votes while Maine was split with 3 for Clinton and 1 for Trump. As of result, the difference is used in the data set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The columns that are used within the data set were pulled from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Federal Election Commission (FEC) API&lt;/a&gt;. Generally if you know how to use one API, most others follow the same structure so the FEC API is fair game for those of you who got somewhat comfortable with the Census API. For an ever growing list of available US government APIs, &lt;a href=&#34;https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=-aapi+api+OR++res_format%3Aapi#topic=developers_navigation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;data.gov&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to go to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;getting-ready&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First take a look at the variables within the data set itself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;names(election2016)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##  [1] &amp;quot;state&amp;quot;        &amp;quot;votes&amp;quot;        &amp;quot;st&amp;quot;           &amp;quot;fips&amp;quot;         &amp;quot;total_vote&amp;quot;  
##  [6] &amp;quot;vote_margin&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;winner&amp;quot;       &amp;quot;party&amp;quot;        &amp;quot;pct_margin&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;r_points&amp;quot;    
## [11] &amp;quot;d_points&amp;quot;     &amp;quot;pct_clinton&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;pct_trump&amp;quot;    &amp;quot;pct_johnson&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;pct_other&amp;quot;   
## [16] &amp;quot;clinton_vote&amp;quot; &amp;quot;trump_vote&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;johnson_vote&amp;quot; &amp;quot;other_vote&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;ev_dem&amp;quot;      
## [21] &amp;quot;ev_rep&amp;quot;       &amp;quot;ev_oth&amp;quot;       &amp;quot;census&amp;quot;       &amp;quot;region&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or view the entire set in a spreadsheet like form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;View(election2016) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we’re looking at the general election, let’s go ahead and define the two major parties with colors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;partyColors &amp;lt;- c(&amp;quot;#2E74C0&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#CB454A&amp;quot;) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;scales::show_col(partyColors)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;part-i-lollipops&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part I: Lollipops&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;lollipop plot&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Cleveland dot&lt;/em&gt;, is essentially a barplot’s cousin where the bar is transformed in a line and a dot at the top. Let’s draw one using the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; here. It means &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; and in this R reads it like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look at all values in the election2016 data set and then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not include the data point DC from the &lt;code&gt;st&lt;/code&gt;, or state column&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = subset(election2016, !st %in% &amp;quot;DC&amp;quot;), 
       mapping = aes(x = r_points,
                     xend=r_points,
                     y = reorder(state, r_points),
                     color = party)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = &amp;quot;gray30&amp;quot;) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = partyColors)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not bad but it is pretty bland so let’s make it nicer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = subset(election2016, !st %in% &amp;quot;DC&amp;quot;), 
       mapping = aes(x = r_points,
                     xend=r_points,
                     y = reorder(state, r_points),
                     color = party)) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = &amp;quot;gray30&amp;quot;) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, y = state, xend = r_points, 
                   yend = state), color = &amp;quot;grey70&amp;quot;) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3, fill=&amp;quot;white&amp;quot;, stroke = 1) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = partyColors) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(abs(x), &amp;quot;%&amp;quot;), limits = c(-35, 50)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;,
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank()
  ) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab(&amp;quot;State&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no what happened? The states are in reverse alphabetical order. Think about how you can fix it to display the data in a better way, try it out and then see a solution using the dropdown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Better representation
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = subset(election2016, !st %in% &amp;quot;DC&amp;quot;),  
       mapping = aes(x = r_points,  
                     xend=r_points,  
                     y = reorder(state, r_points),  
                     color = party)) +  
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = &amp;quot;gray30&amp;quot;) +  
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, y = reorder(state, r_points), xend = r_points, 
                   yend = reorder(state, r_points)), color = &amp;quot;grey70&amp;quot;) +  
  # Here is the fix but what do you think happened?  
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3, fill=&amp;quot;white&amp;quot;, stroke = 1) +  
  scale_color_manual(values = partyColors) +  
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(abs(x), &amp;quot;%&amp;quot;), limits = c(-35, 50)) +  
  theme_minimal() +  
  theme(  
    legend.position = &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;,  
    panel.border = element_blank()  
  ) +  
  xlab(&amp;quot;Party Affiliation&amp;quot;) +  
  ylab(&amp;quot;State&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
If you thought that reordering the column &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;r_points&lt;/code&gt;, then you were correct and win eleventy billion points.
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;side-quest&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Side Quest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can make this plot prettier. First load (or install and load) the following library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(ggthemes)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about themes, please see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ggthemes vignette&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, if you are aware of the data analyst and all around predictive guru Nate Silver who uses analytic and data visualizations for multiple reasons, then the website &lt;a href=&#34;https://fivethirtyeight.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/a&gt; - may be something familiar. We’ll redraw the plot above using a theme commonly found on the FiveThirtyEight website using the options &lt;code&gt;scale_color_fivethirtyeight()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;theme_fivethirtyeight()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = subset(election2016, !st %in% &amp;quot;DC&amp;quot;),
       mapping = aes(x = r_points,
                     xend = r_points,
                     y = reorder(state, r_points),
                     color = party)) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = &amp;quot;gray30&amp;quot;) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, y = reorder(state, r_points), xend = r_points, 
                   yend = reorder(state, r_points)), color = &amp;quot;#5e3c58&amp;quot;) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3, fill=&amp;quot;white&amp;quot;, stroke = 1) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(abs(x), &amp;quot;%&amp;quot;), 
                     expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(-35, 50)) +
  theme(
    legend.position = &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;,
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  ) +
  xlab(&amp;quot;Party Affiliation&amp;quot;) +
  ylab(&amp;quot;State&amp;quot;) + 
  scale_color_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;part-ii-choropleths&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part II: Choropleths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, choropleth comes from the Greek choros (area) and pleth (value). They distribute colors the map regions based on a measure. This is then used for comparisons using the relative value associated with each color of one region to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let’s get some map data…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(maps)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Attaching package: &amp;#39;maps&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## The following object is masked from &amp;#39;package:purrr&amp;#39;:
## 
##     map&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…for all of the states…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;state &amp;lt;- map_data(&amp;quot;state&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(state)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##        long      lat group order  region subregion
## 1 -87.46201 30.38968     1     1 alabama      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;
## 2 -87.48493 30.37249     1     2 alabama      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;
## 3 -87.52503 30.37249     1     3 alabama      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;
## 4 -87.53076 30.33239     1     4 alabama      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;
## 5 -87.57087 30.32665     1     5 alabama      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;
## 6 -87.58806 30.32665     1     6 alabama      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looks pretty big! We can check the dimensions by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dim(state)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 15537     6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we’re going to plot map data using a different set of commands…well sort of in the fact that were not flattening the plot, rather it’s being viewed as if on a globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = state,
            aes(x = long, y = lat,
                group = group, fill = region)) +
  geom_polygon(color = &amp;quot;gray90&amp;quot;, size = 0.1) +
  coord_map(projection = &amp;quot;albers&amp;quot;, lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably noticed that the coordinates for latitude and longitude started where we defined them but you may not know about &lt;code&gt;albers&lt;/code&gt;. I won’t get into the history but &lt;code&gt;albers&lt;/code&gt; refers to the Albers projection which is the industry standard for how maps are constructed. Play around with some of the others some of which were noted in &lt;a href=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/assignment/06-assignment/#mapping-using-estimated-curvatures&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;last week’s assignments page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we need to get our own data on to the map. First let’s lower the case of the column name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;election2016$region &amp;lt;- tolower(election2016$state) # &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case we want the state level data to be primary source since election2016 data is dependent on states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;state_elec &amp;lt;- left_join(state, election2016) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Joining, by = &amp;quot;region&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(state_elec)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##        long      lat group order  region subregion   state votes st fips
## 1 -87.46201 30.38968     1     1 alabama      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; Alabama     9 AL    1
## 2 -87.48493 30.37249     1     2 alabama      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; Alabama     9 AL    1

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a basic test plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = state_elec,
            aes(x = long, y = lat,
                group = group, fill = party)) +
      geom_polygon(color = &amp;quot;gray90&amp;quot;, size = 0.1) +
      coord_map(projection = &amp;quot;albers&amp;quot;, lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try it with the colors we assigned for each party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = state_elec,
             mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,
                           group = group, fill = party)) +
        geom_polygon(color = &amp;quot;gray90&amp;quot;, size = 0.1) +
        coord_map(projection = &amp;quot;albers&amp;quot;, lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +
        scale_fill_manual(values = partyColors) +
        labs(title = &amp;quot;2016 Presidential Election Results&amp;quot;, fill = NULL) +
        theme_map() &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;r better yet, why don’t we go crazy and use the five thirty eight theme!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = state_elec,
       mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,
                     group = group, fill = party)) +
  geom_polygon(color = &amp;quot;gray90&amp;quot;, size = 0.1) +
  coord_map(projection = &amp;quot;albers&amp;quot;, lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = partyColors) +
  labs(title = &amp;quot;2016 Presidential Election Results&amp;quot;, fill = NULL) +
  theme_map()+
  theme_fivethirtyeight() &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve recovered from that, there are many avenues we could explore using this data set. Here we’ll look at the individual candidates and their winnings by the popular vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look for Trump’s winnings…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tr1 &amp;lt;- ggplot(data = state_elec,
    mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = pct_trump)) +
    geom_polygon(color = &amp;quot;gray90&amp;quot;, size = 0.1) +
    coord_map(projection = &amp;quot;albers&amp;quot;, lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +
    theme_map() + 
    theme_fivethirtyeight() +
    scale_fill_gradient(low = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;, high = &amp;quot;#CB454A&amp;quot;) +
    labs(title = &amp;quot;Trump vote&amp;quot;) + 
    guides(fill = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and then for Clinton’s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cl1 &amp;lt;- ggplot(data = state_elec,
             mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = pct_clinton)) +
  geom_polygon(color = &amp;quot;gray90&amp;quot;, size = 0.1) +
  coord_map(projection = &amp;quot;albers&amp;quot;, lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) + 
  theme_map() + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;, high = &amp;quot;#2E74C0&amp;quot;) +
  labs(title = &amp;quot;Clinton vote&amp;quot;) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally we’ll plot them both&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tr1 + cl1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looks pretty clean but something is off or maybe because I’m partially colorblind.The dense color distribution on the Trump map makes it appear that he won everywhere nearly everywhere and since we are looking at population data, Clinton won&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;nrow(filter(election2016, winner == &amp;quot;Clinton&amp;quot;))  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;states. We found this by counting the number of rows after filtering the &lt;code&gt;election2016&lt;/code&gt; data set where the winner was Clinton. Now let’s try to take a look at the legends to get an idea of what may be going wrong. Again here are Trump’s winnings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tr2 &amp;lt;- ggplot(data = state_elec,
             mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = pct_trump)) +
  geom_polygon(color = &amp;quot;gray90&amp;quot;, size = 0.1) +
  coord_map(projection = &amp;quot;albers&amp;quot;, lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) + 
  theme_map() + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
   theme(
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = &amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;, color = &amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = &amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = &amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;)) +
  labs(title = &amp;quot;Trump vote&amp;quot;, fill = &amp;quot;Percent&amp;quot;) + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;, high = &amp;quot;#CB454A&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and Clinton’s winnings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Clinton&amp;#39;s winnings
cl2 &amp;lt;- ggplot(data = state_elec,
             mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = pct_clinton)) +
  geom_polygon(color = &amp;quot;gray90&amp;quot;, size = 0.1) +
  coord_map(projection = &amp;quot;albers&amp;quot;, lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) + 
  theme_map() + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme(
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = &amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;, color = &amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = &amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = &amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;)) +
  labs(title = &amp;quot;Clinton vote&amp;quot;, fill = &amp;quot;Percent&amp;quot;) + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = &amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;, high = &amp;quot;#2E74C0&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And together&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tr2 + cl2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah the percents differ! The range indicated within Trump’s map is shorter than Clinton’s yielding the false representation. To compare them, they should be the same. To do this, we first check out the minimum and maximum values for each former candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;trrange &amp;lt;- range(election2016$pct_trump, na.rm = TRUE) # Check the range of Trump&amp;#39;s percentages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;clrange &amp;lt;- range(election2016$pct_clinton, na.rm = TRUE) # Check the range of Clinton&amp;#39;s percentages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;range(trrange, clrange) # Check the range of both&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1]  4.09 90.86&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well it looks like the standard 0-100% will probably work the best here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tr3 &amp;lt;- ggplot(data = state_elec,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now compare all four plots:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here! That looks better. Now that’s all fine and dandy but individual maps still only tell us about the performance of those candidates among st the states but not against each other. So what we really need to do is to care about the margin of wins. To do this, we can either pick the column &lt;code&gt;d_points&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;r_points&lt;/code&gt;. Since the Democrats lost the general election in 2016 and there was a great deal of coverage regarding the popular vote, let’s choose the Republican points as the comparative baseline and use &lt;code&gt;d_points&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lighter_map &amp;lt;- 
  ggplot(data = state_elec,

&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to look at the map and code. Most of the items are probably familiar by now barring &lt;code&gt;scale_fill_gradient2&lt;/code&gt;. There are many ways to apply gradients within ggplot. If you want to know more, look at the tidyverse page on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_gradient.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;scale gradients&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, its seems a little hard to discern the difference between the choice of reds and blues, especially with purple being the middle color. Let’s try taking true reds and blues rather than a shade of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;darker_map &amp;lt;- 
ggplot(data = state_elec,
       mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = d_points)) + 
  geom_polygon(color = &amp;quot;gray90&amp;quot;, size = 0.1) +
  coord_map(projection = &amp;quot;albers&amp;quot;, lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) + 
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;, mid = scales::muted(&amp;quot;purple&amp;quot;),
                       high = &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;, breaks = c(-100, -75, -50,-25, 0, 25, 50, 75, 100), 
                       labels = c(100, 75, 50, 25, 0, 25, 50, 75, 100)) +
  theme_map() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme(
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = &amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;, color = &amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = &amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = &amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;)) +
  labs(title = &amp;quot;Winning margins&amp;quot;,
       subtitle = &amp;quot;(The Darker Map)&amp;quot;,
       fill = &amp;quot;Percent&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;darker_map&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-45-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, using the range we have includes everyone so there is no reason to stretch out the percentage which makes the coloring lighter. However, I still think that the colors are for The Darker Map are still not bright enough. Maybe the data set is skewing our results. Let’s find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Grab the outliers
outliers = boxplot(election2016$d_points, plot=FALSE)$out &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Extract the row information from the original data frame
election2016[election2016$d_points %in% outliers,] &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well clearly Washington D.C. is the outlier here. What if we remove it…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;darker_map_NODC &amp;lt;- ggplot(data = subset(state_elec,

  geom_polygon(color = &amp;quot;gray90&amp;quot;, size = 0.1) +

    legend.background = element_rect(fill = &amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;)) +  
  labs(title = &amp;quot;Winning margins&amp;quot;,
                subtitle =str_wrap(&amp;quot;(The Darker Map without Washington D.C.)&amp;quot;,30),
       fill = &amp;quot;Percent&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and re plot both darker maps to compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;darker_map + darker_map_NODC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that made a huge difference mainly since the outlier (DC) was such an outlier that it was stretching the color distribution. You can see evidence of this by looking at the legends below each plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;part-iii-choropleths-with-blocks&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part III: Choropleths with Blocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this part, please load the following libraries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(devtools)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Loading required package: usethis&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(statebins)
library(RColorBrewer)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;code&gt;devtools::install_github(&#34;hrbrmstr/statebins&#34;)&lt;/code&gt; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(statebins)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, There is a version of the package &lt;code&gt;statebins&lt;/code&gt; on CRAN but it lacks the functionality we need. More about the new version of &lt;code&gt;statebins&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hrbrmstr/statebins&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You do not have to comment it out after the first installation. Read the message if you attempt to run it again. However at some point there will be an official version posted to CRAN so it is recommended that you uninstall this by using &lt;code&gt;remove.packages(statebins)&lt;/code&gt;. If you get an odd error about &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt; being corrupt, restart your R Studio (make sure to save your work space!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-rcolorbrewer-package&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The RColorBrewer package&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;RColorBrewer&lt;/code&gt; package is the most utilized collection of color palettes used in R. There is a lot of color theory which amazingly is quite interesting and grounded in science and history, but we simply do not have the bandwidth to cover that in this course. But if you’re interested, check out the PBS Eons clip below which addresses the Purple Earth Hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For resources, a few sites you may wish to check out are listed below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://earlglynn.github.io/RNotes/package/RColorBrewer/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RColorBrewer package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the entire set of palettes using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;display.brewer.all()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-52-1.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
which probably looks better in R Studio than here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;statebins&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Statebins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to be using the package &lt;code&gt;statebins&lt;/code&gt; but the basic command does not come with a great deal of flexibility. For example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;statebins(election2016, value_col=&amp;quot;pct_trump&amp;quot;, palette = &amp;quot;Reds&amp;quot;, round=TRUE) +
  theme_statebins()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-53-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is built with the default color palette within R. While it’s fine, without hacking or overwriting the basic commands, we are unable make changes like expanding the limits on the legend. For that, we need the command geom_statebins which does not exist in the CRAN version at the time of this writing. With that command, we have the ability to to work within &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt;. You should also be aware that ggplot really does not like the base R palette! Below, were going to use &lt;code&gt;brewer.pal(&#34;all&#34;, &#34;Reds&#34;)&lt;/code&gt; which calls the Reds palette from &lt;code&gt;RColorBrewer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;basicRedBrews &amp;lt;- brewer.pal(&amp;quot;all&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Reds&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning in brewer.pal(&amp;quot;all&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Reds&amp;quot;): n too large, allowed maximum for palette Reds is 9
## Returning the palette you asked for with that many colors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you catch the Warning? The &lt;code&gt;RColorBrewer&lt;/code&gt; package is nice but limited. We have measures from 50 states but only have 9 colors to account for the differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;show_col(basicRedBrews)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-55-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if we apply it to the plot below…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;trumpNineRed &amp;lt;- ggplot(election2016, aes(state=state, fill=pct_trump)) +
             geom_statebins() +
             coord_equal() +
             theme_statebins() +
             scale_fill_gradientn(limits = c(0, 100), colors = brewer.pal(&amp;quot;all&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Reds&amp;quot;)) + 
             labs(title = str_wrap(&amp;quot;Trump 2016 Popular Vote Percent Distribution&amp;quot;, 30), 
             # Notice the text wrap via thge stringr package.
             subtitle =&amp;quot;(Nine Shades of Red)&amp;quot;, 
             # cough cough proper APA formatting cough cough
             fill = NULL)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning in brewer.pal(&amp;quot;all&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Reds&amp;quot;): n too large, allowed maximum for palette Reds is 9
## Returning the palette you asked for with that many colors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…we get the same warning and the plot looks like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;trumpNineRed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-57-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now sometimes it is a good idea to have a small palette even if you have a large data set which I’ll address later on. However, let’s assume we want 50 colors, and in this case 50 shades of red (not to be confused with another color and what I can only assume is a terrible movie). Unless you really enjoy constructing palettes manually (which many people do!), there is a way to have R do it for you - enter the &lt;code&gt;colorRampPalette&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Define a range of 50 colors based on the RColorBrewer Reds palette.
fiftyRedBrews &amp;lt;- colorRampPalette(basicRedBrews)(50) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;show_col(fiftyRedBrews)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-59-1.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that’s more like it! So let’s try the plot from earlier again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;trumpFiftyRed &amp;lt;- ggplot(election2016, aes(state=state, fill=pct_trump)) +
  geom_statebins() +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_statebins() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(limits = c(0, 100), colors = fiftyRedBrews) +     
  labs(title = str_wrap(&amp;quot;Trump 2016 Popular Vote Percent Distribution&amp;quot;, 30),
       subtitle =&amp;quot;(50 Shades of Red)&amp;quot;,
       fill = NULL)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;trumpFiftyRed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-61-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now compare the other nine color plot versus this newer version with 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;trumpNineRed + trumpFiftyRed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-62-1.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
Did it make a difference? Well that depends on whom you ask. Even if I cannot see one, that does not imply that others cannot. With that said, there are situations where having a smaller palette makes sense. One example of this is when you want to explore groups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;threeRedBrews &amp;lt;- brewer.pal(3, &amp;quot;Reds&amp;quot;) # We&amp;#39;re taking three evenly distributed colors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;show_col(threeRedBrews)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-64-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;trumpThreeRed &amp;lt;- ggplot(election2016, aes(state=state, fill=pct_trump)) +
  geom_statebins() + 
  coord_equal() + # If you run the ggplot and geom_statbins line, it looks rectangular.
  theme_statebins() + # This is akin to the base ggplot2 theme_minimal()
  scale_fill_gradientn(limits = c(0, 100), colors = threeRedBrews) +
  labs(title = str_wrap(&amp;quot;Trump 2016 Popular Vote Percent Distribution&amp;quot;,30),
       subtitle =&amp;quot;(Three Shades of Red)&amp;quot;,
       fill = NULL) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;trumpThreeRed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-66-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the plot, there is an indication from the shading that the the Midwest and south went more for Trump than the coastal areas. This brings us to a good point&lt;strong&gt;Your choice in palettes in both color and range are situationally dependent&lt;/strong&gt;. In a nutshell, never plot blindly and always think about what you want people to see! Remember, you (should) know your data inside and out but is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;that understanding translate over into your visualization and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;visually appealing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, never assume that the same ranges will give you similar results as we’ll see below. However, let’s perform the same type of plot for Clinton firsts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;basicBlueBrews &amp;lt;- brewer.pal(&amp;quot;all&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Blues&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning in brewer.pal(&amp;quot;all&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Blues&amp;quot;): n too large, allowed maximum for palette Blues is 9
## Returning the palette you asked for with that many colors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;show_col(basicBlueBrews)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-68-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fiftyBlueBrews &amp;lt;- 
  colorRampPalette(basicBlueBrews)(50)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;show_col(fiftyBlueBrews)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-70-1.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;clintonFiftyBlue &amp;lt;- 
  ggplot(election2016, aes(state=state, fill=pct_clinton)) +
  geom_statebins() +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_statebins() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(limits = c(0, 100), colors = fiftyBlueBrews) +
  labs(title = str_wrap(&amp;quot;Clinton 2016 Popular Vote Percent Distribution&amp;quot;, 30),
       subtitle =&amp;quot;(50 Shades of Blue)&amp;quot;,
       fill = NULL)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;clintonFiftyBlue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;threeBlueBrews &amp;lt;- brewer.pal(3, &amp;quot;Blues&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;clintonThreeBlue &amp;lt;- ggplot(election2016, aes(state=state, fill=pct_clinton)) +
  geom_statebins() +

  theme_statebins() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(limits = c(0, 100), colors = threeBlueBrews) +
  labs(title = str_wrap(&amp;quot;Clinton 2016 Popular Vote Percent Distribution&amp;quot;, 30),
       subtitle =&amp;quot;(Three Shades of Blue)&amp;quot;,
       fill = NULL)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;clintonThreeBlue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-76-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to view them all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;trumpFiftyRed + clintonFiftyBlue + trumpThreeRed + clintonThreeBlue + plot_layout(ncol = 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-77-1.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at these, it appears that regional differences are best shown by &lt;code&gt;clintonFiftyBlue&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;trumpThreeRed&lt;/code&gt; both of which clearly do not have the same number of colors and corresponding distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;trumpThreeRed + clintonFiftyBlue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-78-1.png&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we know for sure? Let’s check out the distributions for each candidate beginning with Trump&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(election2016) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=state, y=pct_trump, fill = pct_trump), stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(limits = c(0, 100), colors = threeRedBrews) +
  facet_grid(~ census, drop = TRUE, scales = &amp;quot;free_x&amp;quot;) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    legend.position = &amp;quot;bottom&amp;quot;
  ) +
  xlab(&amp;quot;Regions&amp;quot;) +
  ylab(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;) + 
  labs(title = &amp;quot;2016 Presidential Results for Trump&amp;quot;, 
       subtitle =&amp;quot;Distribution by US Region&amp;quot;,
       fill = NULL)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-79-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
Trump’s darker reds are relatively consistent in the Midwest and South but split in the West. If we plot Clinton’s pattern, you would expect to see the opposite and that is exactly what is plotted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(election2016) +
        geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=state, y=pct_clinton, fill = pct_clinton), stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(limits = c(0, 100), colors = fiftyBlueBrews) +
  facet_grid(~ census, drop = TRUE, scales = &amp;quot;free_x&amp;quot;) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    legend.position = &amp;quot;bottom&amp;quot;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton’s darker blues are reds are relatively consistent and concentrated in the Northeast but split in the West. Both of these make sense since Trump won handily in the Midwest and South while Clinton dominated the Northeast. But just to be sure, we’ll look at the comparative data set without DC (since it was an outlier).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(data = subset(election2016,
                       !region %in% &amp;quot;district of columbia&amp;quot;),

                        labels = c(100, 75, 50, 25, 0, 25, 50, 75, 100)) +

Sure, this is a method to see the states that are primarily Democrat or Republican. But its also a way to view how mixed (or purple) we are as a nation as well in terms of our voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Part IV: Augmenting Maps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now staying on the 2016 election focus, we’re going to try to reproduce a better version of the results found in the last plot in Part III. What’s the problem? Well many people concentrate on the popular vote. Regardless of your stance on the electoral college, that representative
system is what we currently live under and did shape the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Recall that Clinton amassed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sum(election2016$clinton_vote)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 65853625&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;votes while Trump garnered&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sum(election2016$trump_vote)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 62985106&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;votes which told us that Clinton won the popular vote by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sum(election2016$clinton_vote)-sum(election2016$trump_vote)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 2868519&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;votes. To explore the electoral college and its impact, a static ggplot map does not allow for more than three variables as we saw in a prior session. So we have to figure out another way to show size. Why don’t we do it by changing the size of the states?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First let’s get a relatively under utilized set of data from the maps package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mapbase &amp;lt;- map_data(&amp;quot;state.vbm&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
rename(state = region)  %&amp;gt;% # Rename the column region to state
  select_if(~sum(!is.na(.)) &amp;gt; 0) # Drop any columns where the entire set is NA&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;.vbm&lt;/code&gt; data set is called a &lt;code&gt;SpatialPolygonsDataFrame&lt;/code&gt; object in R (yes that’s the actual term) but in the real world, it is known as a &lt;em&gt;Visibility Base Map&lt;/em&gt;. What is important here is that the state level longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates been adjusted such that the sizes are as proportionally equal to each other as possible while maintaining the overall shape of the United States. The original point of this was to have all the states be of equal sizes to be utilized as symbols. However, someone much more intelligent than me thought about using it to display demographic data as well. The set looks a bit different than the typical maps data set you have seen before, but its not far off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(mapbase) # or View(mapbase)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##   long lat group order   state
## 1   89  34     1     1 Alabama
## 2   96  34     1     2 Alabama
## 3   98  20     1     3 Alabama
## 4   91  20     1     4 Alabama
## 5   91  16     1     5 Alabama
## 6   89  17     1     6 Alabama&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the states now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;map(&amp;quot;state.vbm&amp;quot;, fill=T, col=&amp;quot;white&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-87-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if you prefer a bit of color in your life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;RViridisD &amp;lt;- viridis_pal(option = &amp;quot;D&amp;quot;)(50) # To view use show_col(RViridis)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;map(&amp;quot;state.vbm&amp;quot;, fill=T, col=RViridisD)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-89-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could have used some other versions of the Viridis set. Try the above for options A, B, C, D, or E. Alternatively, you can use a site like &lt;a href=&#34;http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; to generate small or large color palettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I urge you to follow elements of proper color theory as outlined &lt;a href=&#34;https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/3682/where-can-i-find-a-large-palette-set-of-contrasting-colors-for-coloring-many-d/3815&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here with examples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This next data set &lt;code&gt;state.vbm.center&lt;/code&gt; is made up centroids. These provide coordinates of the centers of the 50 states (in alphabetical order).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data(state.vbm.center) # This is a list. Do View(state.vbm.center) to see it.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have multiple data files so we have to join them somehow. First we’ll look at the set that was just pulled and use only what we need. Extra columns and general data points that we don’t need just add to the amount of time it takes for R to get things done.&lt;br /&gt;

Below we are going to convert the list &lt;code&gt;state.vbm.center&lt;/code&gt; to a data frame using pipes and recall all those do is provide shortcuts for multiple regular R commands. The steps are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call the &lt;code&gt;state.vbm.center&lt;/code&gt; data set&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Force (aka &lt;em&gt;coerce&lt;/em&gt;) the list to a data frame&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add in state names which are given by the variable &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; that we renamed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pull everything into a variable called &lt;code&gt;truncated_map&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;truncated_map &amp;lt;- state.vbm.center %&amp;gt;% 
                    as.data.frame() %&amp;gt;% 
                    mutate(state = unique(mapbase$state))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at what we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(truncated_map) # or View(truncated_map)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##    x  y      state
## 1 93 27    Alabama
## 2 10 19     Alaska
## 3 32 34    Arizona
## 4 76 33   Arkansas
## 5 13 42 California
## 6 46 51   Colorado&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that &lt;code&gt;truncated_map&lt;/code&gt; is simply a conversion of the list &lt;code&gt;state.vbm.center&lt;/code&gt; to a data frame.&lt;br /&gt;

Now let’s merge some data sets by using joins. There are many ways to accomplish the end goal which is to put &lt;code&gt;mapbase&lt;/code&gt; (state level map data), &lt;code&gt;election2016&lt;/code&gt; (our current data set with various types of election information by state except for electoral college votes), and &lt;code&gt;truncated_map&lt;/code&gt; (the centroid data set) together into one cohesive data frame (or file if you prefer). You could arguably download all three and do it in say Excel but it would take quite a while and unless there has been a change in the recent version, it appears you have to do by coding in a language called Visual Basic within the software anyway. Joins are a great way to have computers handle that nonsense and in general, if you ever come across files that you need merged, this type of logic and command structure apples in that situation too!

OK here we go!&lt;br /&gt;

Step 1: Join &lt;code&gt;mapbase&lt;/code&gt; (state level map data) with &lt;code&gt;election2016&lt;/code&gt; (current election data set) and call it &lt;code&gt;merged_electoral&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;merged_electoral &amp;lt;- 
  election2016 %&amp;gt;% 
    filter(!st == &amp;quot;DC&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
# Since DC is not a state, it is not included in the map data set so we need to get rid
# of it.
      right_join(mapbase) %&amp;gt;% 
# Its a right join since the mapbase data has the coordinates to draw our map
          select_if(~sum(!is.na(.)) &amp;gt; 0) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Joining, by = &amp;quot;state&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Drop any columns where the entire set is NA&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at what we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(merged_electoral) # or View(merged_electoral)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 6 x 28
##   state   votes st     fips total_vote vote_margin winner party      pct_margin
##   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;int&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;       &amp;lt;int&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;           &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
## 1 Alabama     9 AL        1    2123372      588708 Trump  Republican       27.7
## 2 Alabama     9 AL        1    2123372      588708 Trump  Republican       27.7
## 3 Alabama     9 AL        1    2123372      588708 Trump  Republican       27.7

## # … with 19 more variables: r_points &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, d_points &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, pct_clinton &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;,
## #   pct_trump &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, pct_johnson &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, pct_other &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, clinton_vote &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;,
## #   trump_vote &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, johnson_vote &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, other_vote &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, ev_dem &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;,

## #   lat &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, group &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, order &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Join &lt;code&gt;merged_electoral&lt;/code&gt; (state level map data with election data) with &lt;code&gt;truncated_map&lt;/code&gt; (the centroid data set) and call it &lt;code&gt;merged_map&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;merged_map &amp;lt;- merged_electoral %&amp;gt;% 
                left_join(truncated_map) # Its a left join since again the &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Joining, by = &amp;quot;state&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                         # merged_electoral data has the coordinates
                                         # to draw our map&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK we’re done and have our full data set. Again, let’s take a look at what we did&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(merged_map) # or View(merged_map)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 6 x 30
##   state   votes st     fips total_vote vote_margin winner party      pct_margin
##   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;int&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;       &amp;lt;int&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;           &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
## 1 Alabama     9 AL        1    2123372      588708 Trump  Republican       27.7
## 2 Alabama     9 AL        1    2123372      588708 Trump  Republican       27.7
## 3 Alabama     9 AL        1    2123372      588708 Trump  Republican       27.7
## 4 Alabama     9 AL        1    2123372      588708 Trump  Republican       27.7
## 5 Alabama     9 AL        1    2123372      588708 Trump  Republican       27.7
## 6 Alabama     9 AL        1    2123372      588708 Trump  Republican       27.7
## # … with 21 more variables: r_points &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, d_points &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, pct_clinton &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;,
## #   pct_trump &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, pct_johnson &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, pct_other &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, clinton_vote &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;,
## #   trump_vote &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, johnson_vote &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, other_vote &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, ev_dem &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;,
## #   ev_rep &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, ev_oth &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, census &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;, region &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;, long &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;,
## #   lat &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, group &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, order &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, x &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;, y &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that we have two sets of coordinates now: The ones for the states (&lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lat&lt;/code&gt;) which differ since those are used to draw the outline and the centroids (&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;) which do not differ except by state and are simply the center point of each state. We need to “scale” or make the standard outlines of the state given by &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lat&lt;/code&gt; by reducing the size of each proportionally. To do that, we need a starting point and an ending point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well we have the starting point which is just the standard outline of the state itself which we saw earlier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(merged_map, aes(long, lat, group = group, fill=state)) + 
  geom_polygon(fill=&amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;, color=&amp;quot;#000000&amp;quot;) +
  coord_fixed() + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  ) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +  
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab(NULL)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-97-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and we certainly have an ending point that are given by the centroids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(merged_map, aes(x, y, group = group, fill=state)) + 
  geom_point(color=&amp;quot;#8b0a50&amp;quot;, size=1) +
  coord_fixed() + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  ) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +  
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab(NULL)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-98-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, these denote the center point of each state&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(merged_map, aes(group = group, fill=state)) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(long, lat), fill=&amp;quot;#FFFFFF&amp;quot;, color=&amp;quot;#000000&amp;quot;) +
  geom_point(aes(x, y), color=&amp;quot;#8b0a50&amp;quot;, size=1) +
  coord_fixed() + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  ) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +  
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab(NULL)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-99-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which implies the largest any state representation can be is the outline and the smallest is the centroid. So within each state, we scale the long and lat points to be closer to the centroid by some factor which in this case are the electoral votes by state.&lt;br /&gt;

First we’ll do it for Trump…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Trump_rescaledByEC &amp;lt;- merged_map %&amp;gt;% 
                  group_by(state) %&amp;gt;% 
                  filter(party == &amp;quot;Republican&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% # Only include where Republicans won
                  mutate(longscale = (votes*10/538)*(long - x) + x, # number of electoral votes x 10 divided by the total electoral votes
                  latscale = (votes*10/538)*(lat - y) + y) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…then view the result…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(Trump_rescaledByEC) # or View(Trump_rescaledByEC)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 6 x 32
## # Groups:   state [1]

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s do the same for Clinton…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ClintonByState_EC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at them both&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;TrumpByState_EC + ClintonByState_EC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edp693e.theoreticalphysed.com/example/07-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-108-1.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then we find indicators of how Trump won. Again this is nice but a side-by-side map is only good when assessing each candidate individually and comparisons take effort. I would personally rather be lazy so let’s view them both on the same map.&lt;br /&gt;

Here we simply do not subset the data by party&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;All_rescaledByEC &amp;lt;- merged_map %&amp;gt;% 
  group_by(state) %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(longscale = (votes*10/538)*(long - x) + x,
         latscale = (votes*10/538)*(lat - y) + y)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it looks like…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(All_rescaledByEC) # or View(All_rescaledByEC)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and here’s the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about the margins you ask? No you didn’t ask. Well here is a plot of those anyway&lt;/p&gt;

  scale_fill_gradient2( low = &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;, mid = scales::muted(&amp;quot;purple&amp;quot;),
                        high = &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;, breaks = c(-100, -75, -50,-25, 0, 25, 50, 75, 100), 
                        labels = c(100, 75, 50, 25, 0, 25, 50, 75, 100)) +
  theme_map() +
  theme_statebins() +
  theme(
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  ) +      
  labs(title = &amp;quot;Winning margins by Popular Vote&amp;quot;,
       subtitle =&amp;quot;with each state resized by electoral votes&amp;quot;,
       fill = &amp;quot;Percent&amp;quot;)  +

  ylab(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;MarginsByState_EC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just to compare both for fun…yes I said fun:&lt;/p&gt;
