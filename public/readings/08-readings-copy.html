<li id="fn1"><p>We are skipping Chapter 8: Telephone Questionnaires and Implementation since as of this writing, a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/wireless202009-508.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> by the CDC using second half 2019 data found that of U.S. households, 61.3% report having only wireless phones, 2.4% were landline only, and 1.0% were without either. With that said, it may be in your interest to read Chapter 8 since the same study also found that 37.2% of households have both, though this estimate has been declining rapidly over the past four years. Regardless while the ability to reach a large audience will likely become diminish soon, currently plenty of people can still be reached using this traditional mode.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
