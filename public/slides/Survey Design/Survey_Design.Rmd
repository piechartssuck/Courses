#  The Tailored Design Method (TDM) 

>- Premised on social exchange perspective on human behavior - *You do something for me, and I do something for you*

>- Assumes that the likelihood of responding is greater when the expected rewards outweigh the anticipated costs - *Increased benefits with decreased costs*

# Approaches to Increasing Benefits 

>- Provide information about the survey
>- Ask for help or advise
>- Show positive regard
>- Say thank you!
>- Support group values
>- Give tangible rewards 
>- Make the questionnaire interesting
>- Provide social validation
>- Inform people that opportunities to respond are limited

# Approaches to Decreasing Costs 

>- Avoid subordinating language
>- Emphasize similarity to other requests or tasks to which a person has already responded
>- Make it convenient to respond
>- Make the questionnaire short and easy to complete
>- Minimize requests for personal or sensitive information

#  Choosing Words and Forming Question 

+ Ask one question at a time

+ Be sure the question specifies the response task

+ Make sure the question applies to the respondent

+ Make sure the question is technically accurate

+ Make sure *yes* means **yes** and *no* means **no**

+ Use complete sentences with simple sentence structures

+ Use as few words as possible to pose the question

+ Use specific and concrete words to specify the concepts clearly

+ Use simple and familiar words

---

# Visual Presentation of Survey Questions (1/2)

+ Choose line spacing, font, and text size to ensure the legibility of the text

+ Integrate special instructions into the question where they will be used rather than including them as freestanding entities

+ Make sure words and visual elements that make up the question send consistent messages

+ Organize each question in a way that minimizes the need to reread portions in order to comprehend the response task

+ Separate optional or occasionally needed instructions from the question stem by font or symbol variation


---

# Visual Presentation of Survey Questions (2/2)

+ Use darker and/or larger print for the question and lighter and/or smaller print for answer choices and answer spaces

+ Use spacing to create subgrouping within a question

+ Use visual design properties to emphasize elements that are important to the respondent and to deemphasize those that are not

+ Visually standardize all answer spaces or response options

#  Double-Barreled Questions – What’s the problem? 

+ Respondents don’t know what you are asking for.

+ If the answer is Yes, then is he or she responding to the advising session being pleasant or meeting the overall goal or both?

+ This can lead to massive bias, unreliable or unusable results.

# General Structural Guidelines

- State both positive and negative sides in the question stem when asking either/or types of questions

- Develop lists of answer categories that include all reasonable possible answers

- Develop lists of answer categories that are mutually exclusive

- Maintain spacing between answer categories that is consistent with measurement intent

# Closed-Ended Questions: Nominal Scales

- Ask respondents to rank only a few items at once rather than a long list

- Avoid bias from unequal comparisons
Randomize response options if there is concern about order effects

- Use forced-choice questions rather than check-all-that-apply questions

- Consider using differently shaped answer spaces (circles and squares if possible) to help respondents distinguish between single- and multiple-answer questions

# Closed-Ended Questions: Ordinal Scales

- Align response options vertically in one column or horizontally in one row and strive for equal distance between categories

- Carefully evaluate the use of numeric labels and their impact on measurement

- Choose an appropriate scale length—in general, limit scales to four or five categories

- Choose direct or construct-specific labels to improve cognition

- Consider how verbally labeling and visually displaying all response categories may influence answers

- Place non-substantive options at the end of the scale and separate them from substantive options

- Provide scales that approximate the actual distribution of the characteristic in the population

- Provide balances scales where categories are relatively equal distances apart conceptually

# And That's It...For Now!

If you are interested in a fairly light yet comprehensive read on how to create or conduct surveys, try reading ***Internet, Phone, Mail, and Mixed-Modes Surveys: The Tailored Design*** Method by *Dillman*, *Smyth* and *Christian*. The Library has an [eBook version of the text](https://libwvu.on.worldcat.org/oclc/878301194) you can access right now with your WVU login.

I also use the text in my [EDP 619: Survey Research Methods](https://edp619.theoreticalphysed.com/) course. Much like this class, the content is free to anyone for personal use. For more information, please look at the licensing information provided below.

I hope this crash course was helpful. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.
