These lessons are a central part of the class—they will teach you how to use R and other packages eventually leading to the tidyverse family.\nInteractive training sections are provided on Data Camp1.\n Advice Carve out some time everyday to go through these. If you try to complete everything in one sitting, it will probably be overwhelming! However if you have familiarity with some modules, please feel free to work ahead.\n Grading The ultimate point of Data Camp is to get you familiarized with an environment that you likely have never seen or been exposed to. While you should absolutely go through each module, there is certainly no expectation that you will get everything right. In fact, the points that you incur don’t mean anything as far as how you are assessed so please use hints as needed! As with any things data science, you’ll learn by doing. If you are a polar personality type when it comes to work (i.e. primarily a perfectionist or mostly careless), then the modules will likely prove to be a challenge. It is highly unlikely that you will be able to comprehend everything by going beyond your limit or that it will just come to you so please work hard but also take breaks, swear2, and ask peers or me for help. Your score is predicated on putting in a solid effort, rather than getting it right because there is no such thing in data science.\n Data Camp Schedule A tentative schedule is given below.

Each type of assignment in this class helps with at least one one of these criteria.\nReflections To encourage engagement with the course content, you’ll need to write a ~150 word reflection about the readings for the day. That’s fairly short as there are ~250 words on a typical double-spaced page in Microsoft Word (500 when single-spaced).\nYou can do a lot of different things with this memo: discuss something you learned from the course content, write about the best or worst type of measure you’ve seen, connect the course content to your own work, etc. These reflections let you explore and answer some of the key questions of this course, including:\n What is measurement? Why do we measure? Can everything be measured? Should everything be measured? What makes up a valid and reliable measure? What makes up a poor measure? How do you choose which type of measure to use?  The course content for each day will also include a set of questions specific to that topic. You do not have to answer all (or any) of these questions. That would be impossible. They exist to guide your thinking, that’s all.\nI will grade these memos using a check system:\n ✔+: (11.5 points (115%) in gradebook) Reflection shows phenomenal thought and engagement with the course content. I will not assign these often. ✔: (10 points (100%) in gradebook) Reflection is thoughtful, well-written, and shows engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance. ✔−: (5 points (50%) in gradebook) Reflection is hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.  Everything else is scored as a 0 which should signal that this is essentially a scaled completion-based system. I am not grading your writing ability, counting the exact number of words you’re writing, or looking for citations from the reading(s). I am looking for thoughtful engagement and that’s it! Do good work and you’ll earn a ✓.\nPlease turn these weekly reflections in the Submission Portal on eCampus.\n Exercises Each class session has interactive lessons and fully annotated examples of code that teach and demonstrate how to do specific tasks in R via Data Camp. You can easily find answers online but without practicing these foundational aspects of R, you may have trouble later! Note that this is also essentially a pass/fail system:\n ✔+: (11.5 points (115%) in gradebook) Exercises are 100% completed. Every task was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Knitted document is clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often. ✔: (10 points (100%) in gradebook) Exercises are 70–99% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. ✔−: (5 points (50%) in gradebook) Exercises are less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.  Again, I am not grading your coding ability, checking each line of code or syntax to make sure it produces the exact output, and most importantly, I am not looking for perfection! Try hard, get frustrated, do good work and you’ll get a ✓.\nI encourage you to work together on the courses if possible, but you must turn in your own work on Data Camp.\n Situations To give you practice with the data and design principles you’ll learn in this class, you will complete three mini projects consisting of situations that necessitate some concept related to assessment and measurement. I will provide you with real-world data and pose one or more questions—you will answer those questions. Sometimes this involves just answering using what you’ve learnt while others involve using R to assess data.\nThe submissions will be graded using a check system:\n ✔+: (85 points (≈115%) in gradebook) Project is phenomenally well-designed and uses advanced R techniques. The project uncovers an important story that is not readily apparent from just looking at the raw data. I will not assign these often. ✔: (75 points (100%) in gradebook) Project is fine, follows most design principles, answers a question from the data, and uses R correctly. This is the expected level of performance. ✔−: (37.5 points (50%) in gradebook) Project is missing large components, is poorly designed, does not answer a relevant question, and/or uses R incorrectly. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.  Because these tasks give you practice for the final project, I will provide you with extensive feedback on your submissions.\n Final project Throughout the course, you will have weekly opportunities to expand and refine your skill set culminating in the development of an instrument which will serve as a final project1.\n  Week 1: Think about assessment.   Construct a one paragraph case for a population2 that needs to be researched, why it should be be studied, and how the data would be quantitative.   \n  Week 2: Create an argument.   Submit a one to three page proposal outlining specific questions that you would like to assess and then describe an instrument that would be used to assess those items. Include general details on what measures would be used.   \n  Week 3. Develop a draft.   Create a draft of your instrument3 by whatever medium you choose and then derive a skeleton. Map the measures directly to the items and group them if possible.   \n  Week 4. Refine the draft.   Based on feedback, amend the instrument if necessary and resubmit for further assessment. Explicitly detail what changes were made using a matrix. After approval, administer the instrument for pilot testing.   \n  Week 5. Address a priori and post analyses.   Submit a one to three page with a description of what approaches were used to assess validity and reliability, and all corresponding data and analyses by csv and an R script, respectively.   \n  Week 6. Refine and submit final instrument.   After amending, submit the final version of your instrument.     These will not be graded using a check system. If you’ve engaged with the course content and completed the exercises and mini projects throughout the course, you should do just fine with the final project.↩︎\n A population does not necessarily refer to people.↩︎\n If the instrument is housed elsewhere (e.g. Qualtrics), then simply provide a link and ensure that access is granted to me.↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e0104337c8b781cccf2129922c0c7224","permalink":"https://edp611.asocialdatascientist.com/tasks/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tasks/","section":"tasks","summary":"Reflections Exercises Situations Final project   You will get the most of out this class if you:\nengage with the readings and materials, use R to complete any analysis, ask for help immediately after giving it (whatever it is) a good faith effort, and keep an open and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.","tags":null,"title":"Assignment overview","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Each class session has a set of required readings that you should complete before doing anything else.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0aa019bdc1e0c98e24563159b8fa2f91","permalink":"https://edp611.asocialdatascientist.com/readings/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/readings/","section":"readings","summary":"Each class session has a set of required readings that you should complete before doing anything else.","tags":null,"title":"Content: Readings","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  This section contains extra material to help you understand a concepts covered for that week.

Head over to The Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University to take a look.\n Logic Models Logic models are simply a visual(ish) way to depict the moving parts of a program. Once constructed, it is a fairly easy way to guide parts of an evaluation and for stakeholders to see if changes need to occur.

That is not meant to be demeaning in any way1. They are typically methodologists and/or have an innate ability to construct studies to determine the needs of a program. However evaluators are rarely content experts and even if they are are, the likelihood of evaluating something within our content is pretty low.

Please remember that life is somewhat chaotic at this time!\n  Course objectives You can measure anything (well mostly) Without a basic understanding of measures, you may not be sitting here today! Measurement is a principle trait and whether it is hard wired, learned, or some combination of both, its absence makes quantitative data impossible to classify. But even in cases where measures are available, how can we know if they are consistent and accurate? Without these checks, instruments such as surveys could never be constructed, much less yield results that could be generalized.\nWhen assessing existing programs, having an ability to test a hypothesis is key in understanding its goals. While evaluation tells us whether a program is producing results or having an effect/impact, (performance) measurement tells us what a program did and how well it did it. In particular, the latter is a necessity and involves collecting and reporting data that can be used to compartmentalize the way a program is being implemented.\nSpecifically, you should be able to:\n assess the credibility and ethics of measurement practices be confident in determining valid and reliable measures have the ability to interpret and report psychometric properties of tests view measurement as a typical step in the evaluative process  By the end of this course, you will hopefully become (1) literate in the connection between data and measurement principles, and (2) a skeptic of every research question or purpose that you come across.\nAdditionally, this class will expose you to R—one of the most popular and in-demand statistical languages. Armed with the foundation of R skills you’ll learn in this class, you’ll know enough to be able to find how to analyze and visualize many outputs based on measures.\n FAQ Is the course content difficult? You’ve probably heard an answer like this before: At times some of the material can be dense. Well that isn’t much of a response. Difficulty is not the issue here since as humans with differing educational background, we will have strengths in some areas more than others. Instead the question is can you identify areas that need strengthened and communicate them? If you can, then you have a good shot at succeeding in this class.\n Is R difficult? Learning R can be especially challenging at first—it’s akin to learning a new language like Spanish or even mathematics. Even experienced R users get frustrated…and so much so that some of us have swear jars. However as silly as it sounds one of the best feelings is to overcome a roadblock. With that said, if you find yourself getting irritated, try the following: take a break, go let some frustration out, sleep, discuss with a peer, etc. If you are at your limit, take a few breaths and contact me!\n What if I find a mistake? Tell me! I strive to be error free but like everyone else, make silly mistakes. This includes grammar and spelling errors as well!\n  Course materials There are four optional texts and two software packages necessary for this course. With that said, you will receive some supplementary materials in the course as well.\nTexts Optional Reference To help minimize costs, we do not have a formal text. However we will rely on the following for readings and reference. All are available through the WVU library WVU library in an online capacity barring the APA 7th edition handbook.\n Balkin, R.

This certainly is not a requirement.\nThere will occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the content page for that session.\n R and RStudio You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language R. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard — R handles all the calculations produces the actual statistics and graphical output, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code. Please note that\nyou do not need to have any programming experience to use R\n R is free, but it can sometimes be a task to install and configure. To make life easier, you can opt to use the free RStudio.cloud service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This is recommended for those of you who do not want to install programs right now but please note that you will most likely have to in the near future.\nThe service is convenient, but please keep in mind that it can be slow and is not designed to handle large data sets or more complicated analysis and graphics. You also cannot customize much with RStudio.cloud. Over the course of the term, you’ll want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud.\nYou can find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.\n  Note: Online help Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and its always the tiny errors in your coding can result in tons of headache. People working in any syntax based software package at any level experience this!\nBut there are multiple resources online to help.\n First you will have access to Data Camp which allows you to relieve professional training that otherwise costs a lot of money. Is it perfect and flashy? Nope but it is interactive and if you pay attention, then R’s initial steep learning curve won’t feel like an uphill battle.\n Second two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q\u0026amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)). I freely admit that StackOverflow has saved me multiple hours of frustration. Just note if you have a syntax or process issue, both sites require you to produce a minimally reproducible example.\n Third using Twitter you can post R-related questions and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.\n Fourth searching for help with R on Google (or another indexed search site) can sometimes be tricky because the program name is,for a lack of a better explanation, a single letter.\n Fifth we have a class chatroom which may be accessed via Slack where you can poise a question. I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond relatively quickly. Ask questions about the readings, exercises, and other course materials. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers and may be able to answer other peoples’ questions too.\n Sixth and lastly you can send items by Slack or email me with questions about content, R or whatever (after giving a graduate student effort of course). Please include the subject header EDP 611 “the title of your email” where the title of your email is given without the quotes. Know that I will not just give you the answer, but am happy to push you in the right direction. If you do email me, please include the following:\n A brief description of the problem and what you have done thus far including the line number of the issue (if applicable). A copy of your data set (if applicable). A copy of your script or Rmarkdown document1 with comments throughout so I know what you’ve tried historically leading up to the issue.   I have a mail filter that will automatically bring your email to a top priority status.2\nYou should absolutely expect to struggle at times, but there is no better and more satisfying feeling than figuring things out for yourself! In the long run, you’re more likely to remember things you’ve figured out rather than those you’ve been shown or told.\n  Tasks and grades You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the tasks page.\n Assignments and Grades You can find up to date descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page.\n   Percent  Task  Location      15  R Training  Data Camp    15  Reflections  Slack Channel    15  R Measurement Project  eCampus/Slack    15  Synchronous Meetings  Zoom    30  Final Proposal  eCampus/Slack    10  Presentation of Proposal  eCampus/Slack      \n Your hours Please watch this video:\n Your hours (formerly known as office hours) are set times dedicated to you the student!3). This means that I will be in my office at home waiting for you to come by talk to me remotely with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.\nBecause of the pandemic, we cannot meet in person. I can meet you online via Zoom. You can request a meeting through either e-mail or Slack.\n Class conduct and expectations Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up or stole from other professors:\n Late work: Barring the final project, past due deliverables will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via eCampus. There are no exceptions to this policy. Please note that I will not accept coursework by email or any other means.\n Participation: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate in class. Engagement is mostly defined by you—if that means commenting and answering questions, neat; if it means sitting quietly and being focused, also neat; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off, not so neat.\n Rubrics: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level, I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:\nWhen writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), there is (typically) no such document as a rubric. If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up). Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor. Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!   Technology use: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. You’re all adults…well I am most of the time.\n   Learning and knowledge during a pandemic Ok I’m going to get a bit philosophical but it’s not too deep and there’s a point so please bear with me. Let’s first start with something at the top of a syllabus that many people skip - the course objectives. Well now that you’re no doubt excited excited, read the rest this rant to figure out if you have learned something or you actually know it.\nWhen course objectives are written explicitly and clearly, they provide the information you need to figure out what a student should be able to do by the end of a given term. In fact, professors often test your proficiency in an area through multiple assessments such as exams, papers, presentations, etc where you are essentially asked to show us what you have learned. But learning isn’t knowledge.\nTo save you from a long philosophical narrative on epistemology, in a nutshell we humans are not really good at evaluating a person’s knowledge within a short timeframe…oh say like a semester. With that said you probably spend a lot of time with you, so you should be pretty good at knowing if you know something but you may not know how to figure out what you actually know. If your head doesn’t hurt and you really want a good indicator that something you learned has become knowledge, ask this simple question that is often difficult to answer:\nCan I explain whatever using basic everyday language so that a fourth grader can understand it?\n So the fourth grader isn’t that important as much as self assessing if you can explain a concept to someone who lacks any basic understanding using every day language. This is basically what good teachers can do, in that they are able to take a high level concept that may be inaccessible to most of us and bring it down to a level we can all generally understand.\nMany, if not all of you will fall somewhere in the spectrum of somewhat to mostly. If you’re sitting on the absolute Yes end, then consider a career in survey research because it can be very fulfilling and lucrative. But if you find yourself on the absolute No end, then please contact me and let’s try to get you where you need to be. There are a lot of moving parts in this course and not being able to translate some of what you’ve learned into knowledge can have a cascading effect. And by now in your life, you should have a pretty good idea when anyone uses the term cascading, its rarely a good thing.\nOn top of what’s noted above and I’m not sure how to articulate this any better - life just sucks right now in general! You may know people who have lost their jobs, tested positive for COVID-19, been hospitalized, or have even passed away. Additionally your personal responsibilities have probably shifted and for whatever reason or combination thereof, you’re probably more stressed than usual. So here is my promise to you:\nIf you keep an open line, show initiative, and let me know ahead of time if something is going not according to plan4, I will do everything I can to help you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class!\n So what does that mean? Well I will absolutely make whatever reasonable and feasible accommodations I can to help you learn the course material, finish your tasks, and to understand what areas you may need to concentrate on. Under these current pandemic conditions, I try to stay flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations. Furthermore, if you feel like you are behind or not understanding everything, please please please do not stay silent! As I said earlier, drop me a line!\nI selfishly want you to learn lots of things from this class (design! analysis! R! creating visualizations!, no parallel lines exist in 3D - ok maybe not that last one but its true and really easy to show. If you want to know, ask!). There is a lot to do in this course and some of the content can be frustrating, so make sure to take breaks, go relax, even curse my name if you have to - do whatever you need to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.\n  Course policies Its pretty simple: Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat. Stay in touch. Be a good human.\n We will also follow WVU’s Code of Conduct.\nThis syllabus reflects a plan for the term but things change and plans change. so deviations may become necessary as we move along during the term. Note that I reserve the right to alter or amend this syllabus and will send notifications if course tasks are affected.\n COVID-19 Statement WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.\nIn a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe the social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines set by the University at all times. While in class, students will sit in assigned seats when applicable and wear the required PPE. Should a student forget to bring the required PPE, PPE will be available in the building for students to acquire. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.\nIf a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes.\nPsychological and Psychiatric Services Life at WVU can be complicated and challenging, especially during a pandemic! You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. Psychological and Psychiatric Services provides free, confidential support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The office is staffed by professional counselors and psychiatrists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students. Please do not hesitate to contact them for assistance—getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n CARE Team If you or anyone you know may be at-risk such as those listed here, please make a CARE referral. You may do so directly at the main WVU CARE TEAM site.\n Lauren’s Promise I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\n Lauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or the Campus Police at 304-293-3136.\nIf you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call/text a private Title IX On-Call Line 304-906-9930.\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at West Virginia University. WVU has instituted procedures to respond to violations of these laws and standards, programs aimed at the prevention of such conduct, and intervention on behalf of the victims.\n Academic Integrity The integrity of the classes offered by any academic institution solidifies the foundation of its mission and cannot be sacrificed to expediency, ignorance, or blatant fraud. Therefore, I will enforce rigorous standards of academic integrity in all aspects and assignments of this course. For the detailed policy of West Virginia University regarding the definitions of acts considered to fall under academic dishonesty and possible ensuing sanctions, please see the West Virginia University Academic Catalog at http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. Should you have any questions about possibly improper research citations or references, or any other activity that may be interpreted as an attempt at academic dishonesty, please see me before the assignment is due to discuss the matter.\n Inclusivity Statement The West Virginia University community is committed to creating and fostering a positive learning and working environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and inclusion.\nIf you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of accommodation in order to participate in this class, please advise me and make appropriate arrangements with the Office of Accessibility Services (304-293-6700).\nFor more information on West Virginia University’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, please see http://diversity.wvu.edu.\n Incomplete Grades Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term. If the instructor agrees, the instructor and the student must negotiate the conditions under which the grade of I will be changed to a letter grade and sign a contract. The date to submit the incomplete work should not be set beyond the last day of class of the following semester. If the student does not complete the terms of contract, then the instructor should submit a grade of F. All incomplete contracts must be filed with the department and Dean’s Office. See the policy at [Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term.

See the policy at http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/enrollmentandregistration/#gradestext.\n Sale of Course Materials All course materials, including lectures, class notes, quizzes, exams, handouts, presentations, and other materials provided to students for this course are protected under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Please review the sharing and editing restrictions prior to distributing or amending any material on this site. As such, the unauthorized purchase or sale of these materials may result in disciplinary sanctions under the Campus Student Code. Basically you can share what you like but don’t try to make a buck.\n Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI) Effective teaching is a primary mission of West Virginia University. Student evaluation of instruction provides the university and the instructor with feedback about your experiences in the course for review and course improvement. Your participation in the evaluation of course instruction is both strongly encouraged and highly valued. Results are strictly confidential, anonymous, and not available to the instructor until after final grades are released by Admissions and Records. Information about how you can complete this evaluation will be provided later.\n University Attendance Policy At West Virginia University, class attendance contributes significantly to academic success. Students who attend classes regularly tend to earn higher grades and have higher passing rates in courses. Excessive absences may jeopardize students’ grades or even their ability to continue in their courses. There is a strong correlation between regular class attendance and academic success.\n Course Netiquette The basic premise is that the etiquette expected of students in the online environment is the same as that expected in a classroom. Common courtesy is the guiding rule of Internet communications. Be prepared to communicate effectively when taking an online course. Following these simple netiquette rules in your online class or education environment will ensure your success:\n Include a professional salutation. In this case, “Hello Dr. Roy” or “Dear Dr. Roy” is appropriate. Include a proper ending such as “Thank you” or “With regards.” Then type in your full name. Never type in ALL CAPS, because it reads as if you ARE SHOUTING AT PEOPLE. Act as professionally, via your writing, as you would in a face to face classroom. Refrain from inappropriate language and derogatory or personal attacks. Do not dominate any discussion. Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion. Disagree with ideas but avoid challenges that may be interpreted as a personal attack. Check that you are replying to the specific person you intend, and not to the entire class. Never give your password to another person. Respect the virtual classroom. Never forward in-class communications or posts by others outside of this virtual space. Never spam your classmates. If you quote someone’s previous post, only quote enough to make your point.  Be aware of the University’s Academic Integrity and Dishonesty Policy http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. You can review the rules, regulations, and procedures concerning student conduct and discipline for the main campus of West Virginia University, at http://campuslife.wvu.edu/r/download/1802350.\n Response Time I generally respond to Slack queries in the same day while responses to emails and discussion posts are within 48 hours, except during holidays. Often, I will reply much more quickly but you should not count on a immediate. Please plan accordingly so that you don’t miss deadlines! I generally return assignments within one to two weeks after a final submission date.\n Technical Requirements Students need to have access to a computer for word processing, e-mail and access to eCampus. Access to the Internet is necessary for completion of this course. Run the Browser Check. This tool will check that you are using a supported Internet browser and have a valid Java version installed. The required technical skills to participate in this course are:\nNavigate the web Use email with attachments Create and submit files in commonly used word processing program formats Copy and paste Download and install software Consult software tutorials and other online sources as a method of learning software features Use syntax when necessary  Notice that programming is not on here!\n Technical Support Technical support regarding your use of eCampus is available by contacting 304-293-4444 (telephone), 1-877-327-9260 (toll free number), itshelp@mail.wvu.edu (email), and/or http://it.wvu.edu (website).\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n   Please do not send a screenshot because neither R or I can run a picture of syntax.↩︎\n In this new normal, I receive an overwhelming number of emails per day and may miss yours if the header is not formatted properly.↩︎\n There is some misunderstanding about what office hours actually are!
