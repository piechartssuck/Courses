If you try to complete everything in one sitting, it will probably be overwhelming! However if you have familiarity with some modules, please feel free to work ahead.\n Grading The ultimate point of Data Camp is to get you familiarized with an environment that you likely have never seen or been exposed to. While you should absolutely go through each module, there is certainly no expectation that you will get everything right. In fact, the points that you incur don’t mean anything as far as how you are assessed so please use hints as needed! As with any things data science, you’ll learn by doing. If you are a polar personality type when it comes to work (i.e. primarily a perfectionist or mostly careless), then the modules will likely prove to be a challenge. It is highly unlikely that you will be able to comprehend everything by going beyond your limit or that it will just come to you so please work hard but also take breaks, swear2, and ask peers or me for help. Your score is predicated on putting in a solid effort, rather than getting it right because there is no such thing in data science.\n Data Camp Schedule A tentative schedule is given below.

Final Proposal Bits Throughout the course, you will have weekly opportunities to expand and refine your skill set culminating in the development of an instrument which will serve as a final project2. Please include your name and submit all documents in either a .docx or .pdf format.\n  Week 1: Think about assessment.   Construct a one paragraph case for a population3 that needs to be researched, why it should be be studied, and how the data would be quantitative.   \n  Week 2: Create an argument.   Submit a one to three page proposal outlining specific questions that you would like to assess and then describe an instrument that would be used to assess those items. Include general details on what measures would be used.   \n  Week 3. Develop a draft.   Create a draft of your instrument4 by whatever medium you choose. Map the measures directly to the items and group them if possible.   \n  Week 4. Refine the draft.   Based on feedback, amend the instrument if necessary and resubmit for further assessment. Explicitly detail what changes were made using a matrix. After approval, administer the instrument for a simulation of responses.   \n  Week 5. Test for validity and reliability.   Simulate data and then conduct an EFA to assess validity and a reliability analysis.   \n  Week 6. Refine and submit final instrument.   After amending, submit the final version of your instrument along with a final description of each measure given by item or group of items. Each measure must be justifiable either by the use of statistical analysis, literature review, or some combination thereof.   Need Help?

Head to to the channel #introduce-yourself and well introduce yourself by tell everyone about you, what you hope to achieve out of this course, and something about you that really defines who you are. For example, here is something about me: I teach course on data visualization BUT I am also 40% colorblind and getting worse! (optional) Provide a picture if you are willing. I am a very visual person as are many other people so pictures help a great deal. However, you are not mandated to do so!    Verify Qualtrics Account Login You may end up using a survey in this course so its a good idea to go to the WVU Qualtrics login page and simply make sure you can login. If you are unable to do so, please submit a ticket to IT or give them a ring at 304-293-4444 as soon as possible.   Think about assessment Since your final product for the course is a proposal grounded in proper and effective measures, we will work on a weekly basis to get you there. For this week, please construct a one paragraph case for a population that needs to be researched, why it should be be studied, and how the data would be quantitatively driven.

Head over to The Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University to take a look.\n Logic Models Logic models are simply a visual(ish) way to depict the moving parts of a program. Once constructed, it is a fairly easy way to guide parts of an evaluation and for stakeholders to see if changes need to occur.

That is not meant to be demeaning in any way1. They are typically methodologists and/or have an innate ability to construct studies to determine the needs of a program. However evaluators are rarely content experts and even if they are are, the likelihood of evaluating something within our content is pretty low.

There are a few ways to go about doing this which we will cover. However for now, just do the following:\nOpen up a new script by going to File \u0026gt; New File \u0026gt; R Script. Save it and any data like the drinks.csv file in a preferably empty folder and name it whatever you like. Go to the menu bar and select Session \u0026gt; Set Working Directory \u0026gt; To Source File Location.  In this session, we will expand on the the tidyverse family of packages along with some help using data from the site FiveThirtyEight fivethirtyeight.\nIf you have already downloaded tidyverse, then please skip ahead to the next paragraph. If not, please do the following:\nselect Tools \u0026gt; Install Packages type in tidyverse and make sure that Install dependencies is selected.  Alternatively, you can simply run the following command in the console\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;, dependencies = TRUE) In either case, now load up the package by typing in following in the script area\nlibrary(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) Now try doing the same for fivethirtyeight by running\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;fivethirtyeight\u0026quot;, dependencies = TRUE) followed by\nlibrary(\u0026quot;fivethirtyeight\u0026quot;) Please note that once a package is on your computer, you never have to install it again unless it is somehow deleted. This means from now on you will only have to use the second command library(\"THAT PACKAGE\") to use that package.\nBefore moving on, here is a good place to reiterate how you can use ? to find more information. When you look at the package list for fiverthirtyeight, not all of the names do a great job of describing what that data set consists of. To see this, type in fiverthirtyeight:: and scroll through the pop up list of available data sets and commands. Let’s say the data set tarantino caught your eye but you weren’t really sure what it consisted of. Hovering over the set in that pop up list tells you that it contains data behind the story A Complete Catalog Of Every Time Someone Cursed Or Bled Out In A Quentin Tarantino Movie.\nOK well that’s a good start but to be able to do anything with that data, we really need to know what its variables are. To do this, run the command below\n?tarantino You should have noticed the Help tab on the lower right hand window is prominent and there is a significant amount of information explaining the data set including the variable names and corresponding descriptions.\n Data Files Data sets used in R are typically accessible in three ways, through these certainly are not the only approaches.\n   Approach  Description  Example Data  Command      Externally  You can get grab files directly from the Internet.2  drinks data  data(“drinks”, package = “fivethirtyeight”)3    Download  Used typically for examples, demonstartions and testing, many packages have data already included.  drinks data  drinks    In-package4  R specific file formats include .RData and .rda but it can load most, if not all types inlcuding popular choices such as a .csv .xlsx, and .sav.  drinks data  drinks      In any case, type the following into your console and you should the following output regardless of approach taken\ndrinks ## # A tibble: 193 x 5 ## country beer_servings spirit_servings wine_servings total_litres_of_pur… ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 0 0 0 0 ## 2 Albania 89 132 54 4.9 ## 3 Algeria 25 0 14 0.7 ## 4 Andorra 245 138 312 12.4 ## 5 Angola 217 57 45 5.9 ## 6 Antigua \u0026amp; B… 102 128 45 4.9 ## 7 Argentina 193 25 221 8.3 ## 8 Armenia 21 179 11 3.8 ## 9 Australia 261 72 212 10.4 ## 10 Austria 279 75 191 9.7 ## # … with 183 more rows If you attempted to load the csv, then you may realize that RStudio puts up both read.csv() and read_csv() as possibilities. The former is what we call a base command, or one that is pre-built into R. However, you will likely want to stick to the latter which is from the readr package which is albeit faster and returns a tibble instead of a data frame. This is just a tidy data frame. You can check what type of variable you have by using class(VARIABLE NAME) on it. For example, the following\nclass(drinks) ## [1] \u0026quot;tbl_df\u0026quot; \u0026quot;tbl\u0026quot; \u0026quot;data.frame\u0026quot; tells us that we not only have a data frame, but a tibble as well as well as some other formats we’ll ignore for the time being. If you want more information, please see Ch 10: Tibbles in R for Data Science.\nNote that we loaded the file directly from a web address URL, but say you had it as a local file on your computer in the same directory as your R script. The command\ndrinks \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;drinks.csv\u0026quot;) drinks would work just as well.\n Chopping a Data Set Up You may already know that the single bracket, [, is useful to select rows and columns in simple cases.\ndrinks[c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), ] ## # A tibble: 5 x 5 ## country beer_servings spirit_servings wine_servings total_litres_of_pure_a… ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Afghanist… 0 0 0 0 ## 2 Albania 89 132 54 4.9 ## 3 Algeria 25 0 14 0.7 ## 4 Andorra 245 138 312 12.4 ## 5 Angola 217 57 45 5.9 There are tidyverse options to handle this via the package dplyr to select rows by number, to select rows by certain criteria, or to select columns.\nFor example, to select rows 1–5, we can use the slice() command.\nslice(drinks, 1:5) ## # A tibble: 5 x 5 ## country beer_servings spirit_servings wine_servings total_litres_of_pure_a… ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Afghanist… 0 0 0 0 ## 2 Albania 89 132 54 4.9 ## 3 Algeria 25 0 14 0.7 ## 4 Andorra 245 138 312 12.4 ## 5 Angola 217 57 45 5.9 Base R allows you to choose the column beer_servings from the drinks data frame in a number of ways. For example, each of the following\ndrinks[, \u0026quot;beer_servings\u0026quot;] drinks$beer_servings drinks[[\u0026quot;beer_servings\u0026quot;]] yields\n## [1] 0 89 25 245 217 102 193 21 261 279 21 122 42 0 143 142 295 263 ## [19] 34 23 167 76 173 245 31 231 25 88 37 144 57 147 240 17 15 130 ## [37] 79 159 1 76 0 149 230 93 192 361 0 32 224 15 52 193 162 6 ## [55] 52 92 18 224 20 77 263 127 347 8 52 346 31 133 199 53 9 28 ## [73] 93 1 69 234 233 9 5 0 9 313 63 85 82 77 6 124 58 21 ## [91] 0 31 62 281 20 82 19 0 343 236 26 8 13 0 5 149 0 0 ## [109] 98 238 62 0 77 31 12 47 5 376 49 5 251 203 78 3 42 188 ## [127] 169 22 0 306 285 44 213 163 71 343 194 1 140 109 297 247 43 194 ## [145] 171 120 105 0 56 0 9 283 157 25 60 196 270 56 0 225 284 16 ## [163] 8 128 90 152 185 5 2 99 106 1 36 36 197 51 51 19 6 45 ## [181] 206 16 219 36 249 115 25 21 333 111 6 32 64 Unlike [, the [[ and $ operators can only select a single column and return a vector.5 The dplyr function select() always returns a tibble, and never a vector, even if only one column is selected.\nFor example, note that selecting rows 1–5 of the beer_servings column using base R gives us a vector.\ndrinks[1:5, \u0026quot;beer_servings\u0026quot;] ## # A tibble: 5 x 1 ## beer_servings ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; ## 1 0 ## 2 89 ## 3 25 ## 4 245 ## 5 217 Whereas in the dplyr world, the same series of functions can be performed using a pipe operator: %\u0026gt;% which retains the table like format.\ndrinks %\u0026gt;% slice(1:5) %\u0026gt;% select(beer_servings) ## # A tibble: 5 x 1 ## beer_servings ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; ## 1 0 ## 2 89 ## 3 25 ## 4 245 ## 5 217 This example may seem verbose, but later we can produce more complicated transformations of the data by chaining together simple functions. For example, it is far easier to use them to select multiple columns like so\ndrinks %\u0026gt;% slice(1:5) %\u0026gt;% select(country, beer_servings) ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## country beer_servings ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 0 ## 2 Albania 89 ## 3 Algeria 25 ## 4 Andorra 245 ## 5 Angola 217 or to get rid of a column\ndrinks %\u0026gt;% slice(1:5) %\u0026gt;% select(-spirit_servings) ## # A tibble: 5 x 4 ## country beer_servings wine_servings total_litres_of_pure_alcohol ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 0 0 0 ## 2 Albania 89 54 4.9 ## 3 Algeria 25 14 0.7 ## 4 Andorra 245 312 12.4 ## 5 Angola 217 45 5.9 We’ll talk more about pipes next week!\n Saving Objects There are two types of saves you should consider at this point\n The workspace save An output save  The workspace save is everything you see in your RStudio window (e.g. the syntax, script, outputs, etc). When you close out of RStudio, you may be asked to save your workspace which essentially means the next time you load a saved script up, you’ll pick up exactly where you left off.\nWhile convenient, it is not recommended that do this. Like rebooting a computer, you really want to have a fresh start every time RStudio starts up. While certainly not mandated, you never know what piece of rogue commands could have affected your progress when you last saved the file. Opting not to save an image of your workspace removes all of the previous commands while keeping your script intact.\nAn output save occurs when you are trying to save a data set or result in a particular format. Firstly, you have to ensure that you have both downloaded and loaded a necessary package. For example, base R does not have an ability to read in and flatten SPSS files. However, installing and enabling the package foreign makes both reading in and writing to SPSS a cinch.\nLet’s say we want to export our drinks output to a csv file. Well luckily we have the package readr already loaded and it has the command write_csv() that does exactly what we want. The command requires that you note the variable name, drinks, and what you want to call it which in this case I am calling new_drinks.csv. If you are wondering, you absolutely have to out the format type at the end.\nwrite_csv(drinks, \u0026quot;new_drinks.csv\u0026quot;) Well that’s great but say we wanted to save it as a SPSS file. Running\n?write_csv doesn’t yield any information about saving any data set or output as a SPSS file. If we run a simple Google search (e.g. with the terms save SPSS R tidy) and click on the first link, it seems like packages foreign and haven saves a data frame as a SPSS file with the latter doing so in a tidy format - having packages that do keep your data tidy will make your life so much easier! Now we can just do the following\nwrite_sav(drinks, \u0026quot;new_drinks.sav\u0026quot;)  Now you are free to go use SPSS for some reason.\n Style Guide Following a consistent coding style is important for your code to be readable by you and others. The preferred style is the tidyverse style guide, which differs slightly from Google’s R style guide.\n The lintr package will check files for style errors.\n The styler package provides functions for automatically formatting R code according to style guides.\n  You will initially be expected to turn in a script with any submission where R is needed. Much like any writing, if your script is easy to read, then it is most likely easy to grade. A messy script without comments, spacing, and style may lead to misunderstandings. Long story short: make it look good and easy to interpret and your score will reflect that! With that said, you’ll receive a template that will hopefully be helpful.\nIf you want a warning about styling your script, open RStudio and go to the Tools \u0026gt; Global Options \u0026gt; Code \u0026gt; Diagnostics pane. Then check the box to activate style warnings. On this pane, there are other options that can be set in order to increase or decrease the amount of warnings while writing in RStudio.\n   Copying and pasting syntax from a browser can cause issues To avoid this, a script with all of the needed code presented in this walkthrough is provided in the download.↩︎\n There are situations where data does not exist in its own file, but rather as an within say a tabel on a webpage.

Save this in an easily accessible folder. Now unzip this week’s data set and take the files - Big5data.csv, Big5codebook.csv, Big5measures.csv, and 03-walkthrough - and drop them all in a folder of their own. If you aren’t familiar with how directories and file paths work on a computer, consider keeping both your R script and data sets in the same folder. It just makes life easier.\nBefore we load the libraries, we’re going to grab a package called surveytools2 that is not on CRAN - the main R repository of packages. In any case, there is a command within the surveytools2 package that will make our lives easier moving forward. To install it, please run the following commands\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;remotes\u0026quot;) remotes::install_github(\u0026quot;peterhurford/surveytools2\u0026quot;) If you are asked to update any packages, please select 1: All.\nNow please go ahead and load up the following libraries or download and load if needed\nlibrary(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;psych\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;corrr\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;surveytools2\u0026quot;) ## ## Attaching package: \u0026#39;surveytools2\u0026#39; ## The following object is masked from \u0026#39;package:base\u0026#39;: ## ## replace Then set the working directory to the location of the script by running\nsetwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)) in your console or by selecting Session \u0026gt; Set Working Directory \u0026gt; To Source File Location.\n Data Files We’ll be looking at a very truncated data set from the 2018 BigFive Personality Test. The full data set is a huge file with 1 million answers to the 50 personality items! You can access it here but be warned that opening a file that size can take a long time or may even crash some computers depending on their processing power and RAM. It is a tab separated csv file.\nSide Note: Loading the Entire Data Set If you want to give the entire data set a go, I am not certain how to load it in Excel, but in RStudio you can use\ntoobig_five_data \u0026lt;- read_delim(\u0026quot;data-final.csv\u0026quot;, delim=\u0026quot;\\t\u0026quot;)  to save it to the big_five_data variable which you can access by running\ntoobig_five_data At this point you probably want to just open up the csv files in Excel and if that is what works, then by all means. While I try to run everything in R, sometimes its just easier to double click it. The problem really lies in the size of a data set. The larger the data set, the more power and time it takes for excel to load it up. With R you avoid this whole idea and the set loads up within seconds, rather than minutes. If you try loading the original data set in both R and Excel, the difference is very apparent.\nIn any case, we will be working with data strictly in R, but never feel bad about opening and wrangling a data set using another application like Excel. For all of my snarkiness towards anything Microsoft, Excel has some nice qualities but don’t tell anyone I ever wrote that.\n  Loading a Local Data Set Let’s turn back to the data set we’ll be using.

That means we should probably pair down both the data set and codebook. For data sets with multiple columns, we can use the select() syntax. Moreover since we are looking at all of the columns that have EXT, we can pull only those using the starts_with() command. For more examples of options that can be used with select(), take a look here.\nbig_five_data_EXT \u0026lt;- big_five_data %\u0026gt;% select(starts_with(\u0026quot;EXT\u0026quot;)) and then we’ll do something similar to the codebook. While we can’t simply select columns because all of the variables are in a single column. Much like in Excel, we can filter rows. To do this in R, we use the filter() command.\nbig_five_codebook_EXT \u0026lt;- big_five_codebook %\u0026gt;% filter(str_detect(ID, \u0026quot;EXT\u0026quot;)) big_five_data_EXT ## # A tibble: 100 x 10 ## EXT1 EXT2 EXT3 EXT4 EXT5 EXT6 EXT7 EXT8 EXT9 EXT10 ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 3 2 3 4 4 2 3 3 4 2 ## 2 1 5 1 5 1 4 1 5 4 5 ## 3 2 5 4 3 1 5 1 3 4 5 ## 4 2 3 3 3 3 2 2 4 2 3 ## 5 3 4 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 4 ## 6 3 1 5 1 4 1 5 4 4 2 ## 7 3 3 4 2 5 2 5 2 4 3 ## 8 3 4 1 3 0 4 1 4 2 5 ## 9 2 4 2 4 4 1 3 1 2 5 ## 10 3 4 4 2 3 2 3 5 1 4 ## # … with 90 more rows big_five_codebook_EXT ## # A tibble: 10 x 2 ## ID Item ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 EXT1 I am the life of the party. ## 2 EXT2 I don\u0026#39;t talk a lot. ## 3 EXT3 I feel comfortable around people. ## 4 EXT4 I keep in the background. ## 5 EXT5 I start conversations. ## 6 EXT6 I have little to say. ## 7 EXT7 I talk to a lot of different people at parties. ## 8 EXT8 I don\u0026#39;t like to draw attention to myself. ## 9 EXT9 I don\u0026#39;t mind being the center of attention. ## 10 EXT10 I am quiet around strangers.  Method: Reverse Coding Sometimes items can be worded ‘backwards’. In these situation, scales need to be reversed to point in the same direction.\nExample For example both these questions might be used to measure the same underlying construct or idea.\nI really like being alone I really don’t enjoy large gatherings  In this situation, if we used the same response scale for each participants’ responses they would simply cancel out.\nWhen aligning the direction, we typically reverse code the one that has a negative, aka the negatively-keyed item. In this case is the second example since it includes the word don’t. There are exceptions to this rule, but they are narrowly defined. For example, someone who states that they “really don’t enjoy large gatherings” doesn’t automatically imply they like being alone. In fact, there are arguably an infinite number of possibilities of things they do like! The only time you can be code all items in either direction are in circumstances where there is a binary choice (e.g. Yes/No questions).\nBut wait…there’s more! You also have to consider the intent of the questions and the participants. This second and final check is crucial to reporting reliable and consistent results.\n:::\nGetting back to the main data set, let’s again look at the codebook.\nbig_five_codebook_EXT ## # A tibble: 10 x 2 ## ID Item ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 EXT1 I am the life of the party. ## 2 EXT2 I don\u0026#39;t talk a lot. ## 3 EXT3 I feel comfortable around people. ## 4 EXT4 I keep in the background. ## 5 EXT5 I start conversations. ## 6 EXT6 I have little to say. ## 7 EXT7 I talk to a lot of different people at parties. ## 8 EXT8 I don\u0026#39;t like to draw attention to myself. ## 9 EXT9 I don\u0026#39;t mind being the center of attention. ## 10 EXT10 I am quiet around strangers. Well it certainly looks like EXT2, EXT4, EXT6, EXT8 and EXT10 are all negative in the context of of assessing extroversion. Furthermore while EXT9 includes the term don’t, it doesn’t orient the statement in a negative way so it stays the way it is.\nRemember that command we needed from the surveytools2 package?

Notice that in the green columns, the numbers flip along the neutral measure (3), or maybe a better observation is that the numerical complement is correct if adding two corresponding cells equals 5. If you have had any upper level mathematics courses, you may notice these as a modulo or mod 5 system.\n  Computing the Internal Consistency There are many approaches when assessing reliability, namely those associated with interviews, experiments, surveys, trials, etc. Internal consistency is foremost one of many existing methods used to measure reliability, and it is typically useful in assessing items (e.g from a protocol, questionnaire, test, etc). It essentially estimates to what degree total scores on an instrument would change or vary if different items were used. Here are four but really three approaches used by a majority of practitioners:\nComposite Reliability Getting a bit ahead of ourselves, composite reliability is based on the factor lodgings in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). We’ll cover this when we address CFAs soon!\n Cronbach’s alpha By far the most utilized approach, it is also very procedural which is typically viewed as beneficial by many evaluators. There are many ways to tell R to compute alpha \\(\\left(\\alpha\\right)\\) but by far the simplest may be to use the psych package\npsych::alpha(big_five_data_EXT_rev) ## ## Reliability analysis ## Call: psych::alpha(x = big_five_data_EXT_rev) ## ## raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N ase mean sd median_r ## 0.9 0.9 0.91 0.48 9.1 0.015 2.7 0.95 0.49 ## ## lower alpha upper 95% confidence boundaries ## 0.87 0.9 0.93 ## ## Reliability if an item is dropped: ## raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N alpha se var.r med.r ## EXT1 0.89 0.90 0.91 0.49 8.5 0.016 0.0123 0.50 ## EXT2 0.89 0.89 0.90 0.47 8.1 0.017 0.0115 0.49 ## EXT3 0.89 0.89 0.90 0.47 8.0 0.017 0.0111 0.49 ## EXT4 0.89 0.89 0.90 0.46 7.7 0.017 0.0126 0.45 ## EXT5 0.89 0.89 0.89 0.46 7.8 0.017 0.0098 0.46 ## EXT6 0.89 0.89 0.90 0.48 8.4 0.016 0.0104 0.49 ## EXT7 0.89 0.89 0.90 0.47 7.9 0.017 0.0119 0.46 ## EXT8 0.90 0.90 0.91 0.50 9.1 0.015 0.0092 0.50 ## EXT9 0.89 0.89 0.90 0.48 8.3 0.016 0.0128 0.50 ## EXT10 0.89 0.89 0.90 0.47 7.8 0.017 0.0120 0.47 ## ## Item statistics ## n raw.r std.r r.cor r.drop mean sd ## EXT1 100 0.67 0.67 0.61 0.59 2.8 1.2 ## EXT2 100 0.73 0.74 0.71 0.66 3.4 1.2 ## EXT3 100 0.75 0.75 0.72 0.68 3.2 1.3 ## EXT4 100 0.79 0.79 0.78 0.73 2.0 1.2 ## EXT5 100 0.79 0.79 0.78 0.73 3.3 1.3 ## EXT6 100 0.68 0.68 0.65 0.60 2.7 1.3 ## EXT7 100 0.78 0.77 0.74 0.70 2.9 1.5 ## EXT8 100 0.59 0.59 0.53 0.49 1.8 1.3 ## EXT9 100 0.71 0.71 0.67 0.63 3.3 1.3 ## EXT10 100 0.78 0.78 0.75 0.71 1.4 1.3 ## ## Non missing response frequency for each item ## 0 1 2 3 4 5 miss ## EXT1 0.01 0.18 0.19 0.34 0.21 0.07 0 ## EXT2 0.00 0.09 0.13 0.30 0.26 0.22 0 ## EXT3 0.00 0.14 0.17 0.17 0.34 0.18 0 ## EXT4 0.12 0.24 0.24 0.28 0.11 0.01 0 ## EXT5 0.02 0.11 0.13 0.20 0.38 0.16 0 ## EXT6 0.08 0.14 0.13 0.35 0.29 0.01 0 ## EXT7 0.01 0.24 0.13 0.27 0.16 0.19 0 ## EXT8 0.24 0.21 0.21 0.24 0.09 0.01 0 ## EXT9 0.01 0.11 0.20 0.15 0.33 0.20 0 ## EXT10 0.33 0.23 0.21 0.15 0.07 0.01 0 There is a lot there and most of those outcomes are useful, but for reliability we really care about the raw_alpha, or the the standardized alpha based upon the correlations.

There are other ways to assess reliability. As you move along in the course, keep in mind that none of these could yield good measures for internal consistency.

As usual, you always have your peers and me if you get stuck!\n Looking Ahead Next week we get into uncovering underlying traits and groupings that a data set may have using a process called Exploratory Factor Analysis.

We will cover some of the dense items in a practical sense.↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8dd4002cb4ac647f78e11eaaa49febed","permalink":"https://edp611.asocialdatascientist.com/readings/04-readings/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/readings/04-readings/","section":"readings","summary":"Literature  Download Digital Copies Read Some Papers Review Some Materials Watch an Optional Video Something Fun     .hvr-sweep-to-left { display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle; -webkit-transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0); transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0); box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); position: relative; -webkit-transition-property: color; transition-property: color; -webkit-transition-duration: 0.","tags":null,"title":"Conspiracies","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"    Refine the Draft Responding   Refine the Draft Like last week, this is a also a two step-process:\nRefine your instrument if needed1\n In a word file, create a five column table like so\n     index  item  measure  group  changes               where a. index is an item number given in order of appearance.\nb. item is a statement or question.\nc. measure is the associated measure.\nd. group is the associated group of items, if applicable.\ne. changes is a brief description of any alterations performed, if applicable.\n Submit this document to eCampus.\nThe entire sequence leading up to the final proposal can be found on the main Tasks page.\n Responding Please create one response for the post below on Slack.\n   Reading  Slack Channel  Link      Read over the paper and argument given by yoru peer.

Save this in an easily accessible folder. Now unzip this week’s data set and take the files - ConspiracyData.csv, ConspiracyCodebook.csv, ConspiracyMeasures.csv, and 04-walkthrough - and drop them all in a folder of their own. The Watkins (2018) article is a well written and handy guide to an otherwise dense statistical approach we’ll be using today.\nBefore we load the libraries, we’re going to grab a package called psych that is on CRAN. To install it, please run the following command in your console\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;psych\u0026quot;, dependencies = TRUE) or you can simply use the dropdown menu by going to Tools \u0026gt; Install Packages and simply type in psych. Remember to have Install dependencies checkmarked!\nIf you would like to know more about the psych package and gain access to an extensive set of resources for personality and psychological tests, take a look at the Personality Project.\nNow please go ahead and load up the following libraries or download and load if needed\nlibrary(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;psych\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;reactable\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;polycor\u0026quot;) Then set the working directory to the location of the script by running\nsetwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)) in your console or by selecting Session \u0026gt; Set Working Directory \u0026gt; To Source File Location.\n Data Files We’ll be looking at responses from a sample of 2449 people who took this test in 2016.\n Loading a Local Data Set To load the data set, codebook, and measures, run the following\nconspiracy_data \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;ConspiracyData.csv\u0026quot;) ## ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## cols( ## Q1 = col_double(), ## Q2 = col_double(), ## Q3 = col_double(), ## Q4 = col_double(), ## Q5 = col_double(), ## Q6 = col_double(), ## Q7 = col_double(), ## Q8 = col_double(), ## Q9 = col_double(), ## Q10 = col_double(), ## Q11 = col_double(), ## Q12 = col_double(), ## Q13 = col_double(), ## Q14 = col_double(), ## Q15 = col_double() ## ) conspiracy_codebook \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;ConspiracyCodebook.csv\u0026quot;) ## ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## cols( ## Item = col_character(), ## Description = col_character() ## ) conspiracy_measures\u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;ConspiracyMeasures.csv\u0026quot;) ## ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## cols( ## Measure = col_double(), ## Description = col_character() ## ) and take a look at each\nconspiracy_codebook %\u0026gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## Item Description ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;

Let’s fix it by specifying the number of rows that appear and give it a search box.\nreactable(conspiracy_codebook, searchable = TRUE, defaultPageSize = 3)  {\"x\":{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"Reactable\",\"attribs\":{\"data\":{\"Item\":[\"Q1\",\"Q2\",\"Q3\",\"Q4\",\"Q5\",\"Q6\",\"Q7\",\"Q8\",\"Q9\",\"Q10\",\"Q11\",\"Q12\",\"Q13\",\"Q14\",\"Q15\"],\"Description\":[\"The government is involved in the murder of innocent citizens and/or well-known public figures, and keeps this a secret\",\"The power held by heads of state is second to that of small unknown groups who really control world politics\",\"Secret organizations communicate with extraterrestrials, but keep this fact from the public\",\"The spread of certain viruses and/or diseases is the result of the deliberate, concealed efforts of some organization\",\"Groups of scientists manipulate, fabricate, or suppress evidence in order to deceive the public\",\"The government permits or perpetrates acts of terrorism on its own soil, disguising its involvement\",\"A small, secret group of people is responsible for making all major world decisions, such as going to war\",\"Evidence of alien contact is being concealed from the public\",\"Technology with mind-control capacities is used on people without their knowledge\",\"New and advanced technology which would harm current industry is being suppressed\",\"The government uses people as patsies to hide its involvement in criminal activity\",\"Certain significant events have been the result of the activity of a small group who secretly manipulate world events\",\"Some UFO sightings and rumors are planned or staged in order to distract the public from real alien contact\",\"Experiments involving new drugs or technologies are routinely carried out on the public without their knowledge or consent\",\"A lot of important information is deliberately concealed from the public out of self-interest\"]},\"columns\":[{\"accessor\":\"Item\",\"name\":\"Item\",\"type\":\"character\"},{\"accessor\":\"Description\",\"name\":\"Description\",\"type\":\"character\"}],\"searchable\":true,\"defaultPageSize\":3,\"paginationType\":\"numbers\",\"showPageInfo\":true,\"minRows\":1,\"dataKey\":\"958574ccb2fe85dc6995e67b3618d682\",\"key\":\"958574ccb2fe85dc6995e67b3618d682\"},\"children\":[]},\"class\":\"reactR_markup\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Now that is certainly better but if you don’t like it, just change the 3 in defaultPageSize = 3 to whatever you want.\nMoving on, what if the data set is big? Then we might have an even bigger problem in how to display it. Let’s remind ourselves of the dimensions\ndim(conspiracy_data) ## [1] 2495 15 That’s 2495 rows by 15 columns which is a pretty big data set and unlike the codebook, sometimes its nice to have options when it comes to looking at the number of rows and highlight the one I’m on. It may also be nice to save it as as something easier to recall like a word (aka a variable).

That’s a bit better, though its certainly not perfect. There are a lot of things you can change about the table to make it easier to use. If you want to know more take a look at this vignette. Don’t be scared off by the syntax. Remember its open source so just copy and paste. Eventually if you want to change certain aspects, just start tweaking what’s already there.\nFor example, I think that reactable’s ability toggle a table dark and light mode would be something nice to have.

effort, I have this table with a nice option to fool around with the aesthetics a bit and it all took about 10 seconds. This isn’t unique! You have this ability with nearly everything in R. So don’t code…just copy and tweak. You learn R by tinkering and using it, not by having nightmares about coding2. OK enough of that, let’s get to our method of the day.\n Method: Explanatory Factor Analysis Suppose you are conducting a survey and you want to know whether the items in the survey have similar patterns of responses, do these items hang out together to create a construct? This is the underlying principle of a factor analysis, or FA.\nThe basic assumption of a FA is that for a collection of observed variables, there are a set of underlying variables called factors which are smaller than those observed variables that can explain the interrelationships among those variables.\nMoving forward, we’re going to conduct what is known as a single-factor exploratory factor analysis, or EFA. When you’re using this in the real world, be sure to use a dataset like this one, in that it only contains item responses in a numerical format - other types of data will cause errors and/or incorrect results. In the GCBS the scale is numeric so our dataset will do.\nIn a nutshell, an EFA is just a statistical method used to uncover underlying categorizations, groups, structures often hidden within a data set. This is done by assessing measures and could easily serve as your group level data! As a result, you can measure the internal reliability of a measure as well.\nA Few Things When you have an instrument with multiple scales, there are three standard approaches, of which we will only look at the last.\n   EFA approach  Complexity  Retention  Description      Performed accounting for multiple scales  Most  Information is lossless  Between items of the same AND different scales    Performed on scales that have been reduced  Less  Information gathered from higher order scales is lost due to reduction  Between items of the same AND different scales at the lowest scaling    Performed on grouped items with like scales  Minimal  Only information between items with the same scaling is retained  Between items of the same scale      Given that we’ll be only concentrating on the latter, you may have to run more than one EFA. After conducting the EFA, there are some things to consider if and when implementing your next one whihc we will cover at the end.\n Example Theoretically a five-point likert scale will have five underlying factors, or one for each choice. However in practice, this is rarely the case and we tend to treat the scale as an upper limit - ergo we can’t have more than five factors. So to decide on the number of factors, we use what is called a scree plot. Let’s do this for the first ten rows of our data set.\nconspiracy_data_10 \u0026lt;- conspiracy_data %\u0026gt;% head(n=10) scree(conspiracy_data_10) ## In smc, smcs \u0026lt; 0 were set to .0 ## In smc, smcs \u0026lt; 0 were set to .0 ## In smc, smcs \u0026lt; 0 were set to .0 ## In factor.scores, the correlation matrix is singular, an approximation is used We’re going to ignore the y-axis and just look at where the open circle seems to cross that horizontal line. It looks like this happens around 3, so we can that there are likely three factors.\nConducting an EFA is relatively straight forward in R, and can be performed in any number of packages. In our case, we’ll use the popular psych package and the command fa() where we define the number of factors by nfactors.\nEFA \u0026lt;- fa(conspiracy_data_10, nfactors = 3) ## In smc, smcs \u0026lt; 0 were set to .0 ## In smc, smcs \u0026lt; 0 were set to .0 ## In smc, smcs \u0026lt; 0 were set to .0 ## Loading required namespace: GPArotation ## In factor.scores, the correlation matrix is singular, an approximation is used and then to view the results\nEFA ## Factor Analysis using method = minres ## Call: fa(r = conspiracy_data_10, nfactors = 3) ## Standardized loadings (pattern matrix) based upon correlation matrix ## MR1 MR2 MR3 h2 u2 com ## Q1 0.79 0.19 0.08 0.94 0.0613 1.1 ## Q2 0.69 0.16 0.19 0.87 0.1253 1.3 ## Q3 -0.01 0.93 -0.04 0.84 0.1636 1.0 ## Q4 0.41 0.61 0.05 0.89 0.1061 1.8 ## Q5 0.68 0.37 0.04 0.95 0.0497 1.5 ## Q6 -0.02 -0.07 0.97 0.87 0.1318 1.0 ## Q7 0.93 0.12 -0.06 0.94 0.0629 1.0 ## Q8 0.15 0.78 0.03 0.80 0.2037 1.1 ## Q9 0.71 -0.29 0.09 0.43 0.5680 1.4 ## Q10 0.33 -0.12 0.77 0.99 0.0068 1.4 ## Q11 0.92 -0.03 0.09 0.95 0.0501 1.0 ## Q12 1.02 -0.10 -0.01 0.92 0.0760 1.0 ## Q13 0.05 0.82 0.15 0.84 0.1632 1.1 ## Q14 0.81 0.12 0.10 0.92 0.0754 1.1 ## Q15 -0.06 0.17 0.94 0.94 0.0626 1.1 ## ## MR1 MR2 MR3 ## SS loadings 6.68 3.41 3.00 ## Proportion Var 0.45 0.23 0.20 ## Cumulative Var 0.45 0.67 0.87 ## Proportion Explained 0.51 0.26 0.23 ## Cumulative Proportion 0.51 0.77 1.00 ## ## With factor correlations of ## MR1 MR2 MR3 ## MR1 1.00 0.59 0.73 ## MR2 0.59 1.00 0.31 ## MR3 0.73 0.31 1.00 ## ## Mean item complexity = 1.2 ## Test of the hypothesis that 3 factors are sufficient. ## ## The degrees of freedom for the null model are 105 and the objective function was 165.97 with Chi Square of 525.57 ## The degrees of freedom for the model are 63 and the objective function was 140.43 ## ## The root mean square of the residuals (RMSR) is 0.04 ## The df corrected root mean square of the residuals is 0.05 ## ## The harmonic number of observations is 10 with the empirical chi square 3.45 with prob \u0026lt; 1 ## The total number of observations was 10 with Likelihood Chi Square = 163.84 with prob \u0026lt; 6.5e-11 ## ## Tucker Lewis Index of factoring reliability = -0.896 ## RMSEA index = 0.386 and the 90 % confidence intervals are 0.343 0.501 ## BIC = 18.77 ## Fit based upon off diagonal values = 1  Viewing and Visualizing Factors Each result using the fa() command actually gives you a list, and each element of the list contains specific information about the analysis, including factor loadings. Factor loadings represent the strength and of the relationship between each item and the underlying factor, and they can range from -1 to 1.

This type of visualization can be a helpful way to represent your results.\nfa.diagram(EFA) For those of you who may be wondering, those numbers on the lines going from the items to the factors is called a factor loading, which is the correlation between the observed score and the latent score. Generally, the higher the better since the square of factor loading can be directly translated as item reliability. The other number between the factors is called a factor correlation that I am definitely not going to cover here other than to say that it tells us how well the factors correlate with each other. Since you are just learning about EFAs, disregard both of these for right now and just focus on the underlying concept of a factor and possibly think about how amazing it is that an algorithm and statistical approach can group variables together simply from raw response data.\n Side Note: Lack of Pipes So why can’t we just use pipes and ggplot here? Well the main problem can be found using this command\nclass(EFA) ## [1] \u0026quot;psych\u0026quot; \u0026quot;fa\u0026quot; Notice that the psych package has its own data type called “psych”. Tidy involves data that is neatly in rows and columns. In any case, we’ll stick to the default format for now.\nYou can actually use the class() syntax to figure out the data type for any variable in R.\nAnyway getting back to the issue, we have three factors consisting of certain items. Now the final step is to go back and decide compartmentalize MR1, MR2, and MR3 based on how the questions are grouped.\n  Interpreting Factor Scores …using Items Let’s take a look at the codebook, but this time look at them by items within factors\nMR1_factor \u0026lt;- conspiracy_codebook %\u0026gt;% filter(str_detect(Item, paste(c(\u0026quot;Q12\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Q7\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Q11\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Q14\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Q1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Q9\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Q2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Q5\u0026quot;), collapse = \u0026#39;|\u0026#39;))) MR2_factor \u0026lt;- conspiracy_codebook %\u0026gt;% filter(str_detect(Item, paste(c(\u0026quot;Q3\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Q13\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Q8\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Q4\u0026quot;), collapse = \u0026#39;|\u0026#39;))) MR3_factor \u0026lt;- conspiracy_codebook %\u0026gt;% filter(str_detect(Item, paste(c(\u0026quot;Q6\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Q15\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Q10\u0026quot;), collapse = \u0026#39;|\u0026#39;))) If you’re interested, the | is called a logical operator and it means the word or.

Regardless the idea should always be in the context of your original purpose and research questions.\nThe additional benefit here is that these interpretations can serve as natural groupings, or ones that are derived from, rather than labeling them prior to a statistical analysis.\n …using Participants An EFA contains information about factor scores for each participant in your data set These scores are indicators of how much or how little of the factor each participant likely possesses. Please note that factor scores are not calculated for respondents with missing data. That issue will be tackled in next week’s walkthrough. Anyway let’s take a look at our data by calculating the total scores.\nTo see an example, lets first look at the raw data for the first six participants\nhead(conspiracy_data_10) ## # A tibble: 6 x 15 ## Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8 Q9 Q10 Q11 Q12 Q13 ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 5 5 3 5 5 5 5 3 4 5 5 5 3 ## 2 5 5 5 5 5 3 5 5 1 4 4 5 4 ## 3 2 4 1 2 2 2 4 2 2 4 2 4 0 ## 4 5 4 1 2 4 5 4 1 4 5 5 5 1 ## 5 5 4 1 4 4 5 4 3 1 5 5 5 3 ## 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## # … with 2 more variables: Q14 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Q15 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; or if you prefer, we can show this using\nreactable(conspiracy_data_10)  {\"x\":{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"Reactable\",\"attribs\":{\"data\":{\"Q1\":[5,5,2,5,5,1,4,5,1,1],\"Q2\":[5,5,4,4,4,1,3,4,1,2],\"Q3\":[3,5,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1],\"Q4\":[5,5,2,2,4,1,3,3,1,1],\"Q5\":[5,5,2,4,4,1,4,4,1,1],\"Q6\":[5,3,2,5,5,1,3,5,1,5],\"Q7\":[5,5,4,4,4,1,3,5,1,1],\"Q8\":[3,5,2,1,3,1,4,5,1,1],\"Q9\":[4,1,2,4,1,1,2,5,1,1],\"Q10\":[5,4,4,5,5,1,3,5,1,4],\"Q11\":[5,4,2,5,5,1,3,5,1,1],\"Q12\":[5,5,4,5,5,1,2,5,1,1],\"Q13\":[3,4,0,1,3,1,2,3,1,1],\"Q14\":[5,4,2,4,5,1,3,4,1,1],\"Q15\":[5,5,4,5,5,1,4,5,1,5]},\"columns\":[{\"accessor\":\"Q1\",\"name\":\"Q1\",\"type\":\"numeric\"},{\"accessor\":\"Q2\",\"name\":\"Q2\",\"type\":\"numeric\"},{\"accessor\":\"Q3\",\"name\":\"Q3\",\"type\":\"numeric\"},{\"accessor\":\"Q4\",\"name\":\"Q4\",\"type\":\"numeric\"},{\"accessor\":\"Q5\",\"name\":\"Q5\",\"type\":\"numeric\"},{\"accessor\":\"Q6\",\"name\":\"Q6\",\"type\":\"numeric\"},{\"accessor\":\"Q7\",\"name\":\"Q7\",\"type\":\"numeric\"},{\"accessor\":\"Q8\",\"name\":\"Q8\",\"type\":\"numeric\"},{\"accessor\":\"Q9\",\"name\":\"Q9\",\"type\":\"numeric\"},{\"accessor\":\"Q10\",\"name\":\"Q10\",\"type\":\"numeric\"},{\"accessor\":\"Q11\",\"name\":\"Q11\",\"type\":\"numeric\"},{\"accessor\":\"Q12\",\"name\":\"Q12\",\"type\":\"numeric\"},{\"accessor\":\"Q13\",\"name\":\"Q13\",\"type\":\"numeric\"},{\"accessor\":\"Q14\",\"name\":\"Q14\",\"type\":\"numeric\"},{\"accessor\":\"Q15\",\"name\":\"Q15\",\"type\":\"numeric\"}],\"defaultPageSize\":10,\"paginationType\":\"numbers\",\"showPageInfo\":true,\"minRows\":1,\"dataKey\":\"a36d1b249cb0aa146924f5b6e9de3e72\",\"key\":\"a36d1b249cb0aa146924f5b6e9de3e72\"},\"children\":[]},\"class\":\"reactR_markup\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} We can then apply rowSums() command to see the total scores for these respondents.\nconspiracy_data_10 %\u0026gt;% head() %\u0026gt;% rowSums() ## [1] 68 65 37 55 59 15 Then let’s look at the first six participant factor scores to see the relationship between those and the responses.\nhead(EFA$scores) ## MR1 MR2 MR3 ## [1,] 0.9424517 0.8902524 0.7404219 ## [2,] 0.7800917 1.8475388 0.1314532 ## [3,] -0.1400622 -0.8264001 -0.2598484 ## [4,] 0.8861106 -0.9053159 0.8159931 ## [5,] 0.8020422 0.1576844 0.8300740 ## [6,] -1.3316336 -0.7584980 -1.6976942 and with their descriptive summary\nsummary(EFA$scores) ## MR1 MR2 MR3 ## Min. :-1.3316 Min. :-0.9210 Min. :-1.6977 ## 1st Qu.:-1.0170 1st Qu.:-0.8094 1st Qu.:-0.2542 ## Median : 0.3200 Median :-0.3004 Median : 0.3749 ## Mean : 0.0000 Mean : 0.0000 Mean : 0.0000 ## 3rd Qu.: 0.8336 3rd Qu.: 0.6661 3rd Qu.: 0.7523 ## Max. : 0.9425 Max. : 1.8475 Max. : 0.8301 I can plot the density curve\nplot(density(EFA$scores, na.rm = TRUE), main = \u0026quot;Factor Scores\u0026quot;) to get a feel for how the data looks. So what does it all mean? Well this was an example of how to go about performing one so we used a very small subset of the entire population for the purposes of shwoing an example. You should always perform an EFA in your entire data set where applicable, unless there is an underlying reason not to.\nHowever interpretations aren’t conducted at the individual level, rather they are generalized across a larger sample. This means creating overarching statements about any of these ten participants separately would be complete nonsense, rather doing this can provide indicators of what you may see when implementing an EFA on the entire sample.\nIf you want to know what the study said broadly, please take a look over the Brotherton, French \u0026amp; Pickering (2013) paper.\n  Caveaut OK so we’ve conducted an EFA, but what I didn’t tell you is that there are some guidelines to think about before implementing one. For those who have not had a statistics course may consider skipping the first for now, though the basic idea of the variance is given in this footer3\nEach factor must only contain items explaining at least 10% of the variance in its respective factor. Each factor is recommended to have at least three items. Each factor must be interpreted in a reasonable and applicable way. 4 It is recommended that your factoring do not have items that appear in multiple factors with a similar magnitude - aka the measure of an item on the factor.   Let’s Stop Here OK that’s enough. Factor analysis can be quite useful, but it is also often overused and interpretations are made beyond the scope of EFAs can actually tell us. Again this has been simplified, though it may not feel like it right now. Regardless when we lose complexity, a lot of the additional assumptions, benefits, possible outcomes, side effects, etc are lost as well so I encourage you to further explore EFAs and after you get “comfortable” with them, take a look at confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) as well.\n Looking Forward Recall that a factor analysis can only be performed on a full set of data, but what if you don’t have that? Its something we deal with all of the time and we’ll talk about how to deal with missingness next week!\n  I am personally fond of the BSR.↩︎\n Yuck↩︎\n We essentially want a way to describe the spread of our data from one end to another, or dispersion. We have some ways to do this such as mean, median, and mode but that doesn’t tell us the whole picture since these are just ways to describe the average. They essentially do not say anything about how far away from the mean, median, or mode is from the raw data since that varies - ergo the term variance.↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3bc23a4eb0c43f4786592114edd8396c","permalink":"https://edp611.asocialdatascientist.com/walkthroughs/04-walkthrough/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/walkthroughs/04-walkthrough/","section":"walkthroughs","summary":"Take This Read Up Data Files Prerequisites Data Files Loading a Local Data Set Method: Explanatory Factor Analysis  A Few Things Example Viewing and Visualizing Factors Side Note: Lack of Pipes  Interpreting Factor Scores  …using Items …using Participants  Caveaut Let’s Stop Here Looking Forward    function resizeIframe(obj) { obj.","tags":null,"title":"Conspiracies","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   Data Camp   Data Camp This week please complete the Survey and Measurement Development in R course on Data Camp.\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"da443c5a3ce25b5d2f86c6387259e4e1","permalink":"https://edp611.asocialdatascientist.com/datacamp/05-module/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/datacamp/05-module/","section":"datacamp","summary":"   Data Camp   Data Camp This week please complete the Survey and Measurement Development in R course on Data Camp.\n ","tags":null,"title":"Nerds","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"    Week 5 Overview   Week 5 Overview   eCampus  Slack  Description  Location            Complete a module in Data Camp that addresses survey design using R.

Now unzip this week’s data set and take the files that start with Nerdy and end a .csv - and drop them all in a folder of their own.\nBefore we load the libraries, we’re going to grab three packages called mice and naniar that are on CRAN. To install them, please run the following command in your console\ninstall.packages(c(\u0026quot;mice\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;naniar\u0026quot;), dependencies = TRUE) or you can simply use the dropdown menu by going to Tools \u0026gt; Install Packages and type in mice, naniar or mice naniar. Remember to have Install dependencies checkmarked!\nIf you would like to know more about the mice package and/or the concept of imputation, take a look at the Flexibile Imputation of Missing Data site.\nNow please go ahead and load up the following libraries or download and load if needed\nlibrary(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;mice\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;naniar\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;reactable\u0026quot;) Then set the working directory to the location of the script by running\nsetwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)) in your console or by selecting Session \u0026gt;

Great questions!\nSome analyses like linear regression that you covered this week require complete observations, but still in most statistical software you won’t get an error when feeding the system with data containing missing values (cough cough but R does tell you there’s an error cough cough).\nInstead, most non R softwares automatically delete incomplete cases…and silently at that which is pretty rude. However, if you plan to say make conclusions about the entire data set. an interpretation just wouldn’t be appropriate since you cannot guarantee the same observations. Even worse, by dropping the observations completely we lose statistical power which in a nutshell results in a likelihood that you’ll conclude that there isn’t an effect when there is (aka a Type II error). Oh but it gets even better, the dropped observations could provide crucial information about the problem of interest resulting in biased results.\nIn practice, this can be the difference between being able to conclude a treatment likely works and reporting maybe something happened but we don’t know. So missing data is a big problem that we still haven’t been able to tackle directly yet^[…though recent advances in machine learning have brought us closer in the past three years than we have had in the past 50).\nTo tackle this issue, there are two prevailing philosophical approaches. On one side are those who believe that the data is what it is and you have to deal with what you get. On the other side you have those that believe a machine, whether it be using an algorithm by itself or coupled with artificial intelligence, can predict the likely values that should have been there given certain assumptions are met (which we cover in the next section)1.\nSo for the latter group, there are a number of tactics that can be used to tackle this missingness issue, but the main three are\npairwise deletion: a method in which data for a variable pertinent to a specific assessment are included, even if values for the same individual on other variables are missing.\n listwise deletion: a method in which an entire case record is excluded from statistical analysis if values are found to be missing for any variable of interest.\n imputation: a procedure for filling in missing values in a data set before analyzing the resultant completed data set.\n  Most people in this camp use the deletion techniques as a last resort because there is wariness about removing data. In this walkthrough, we’ll cover the last approach: imputation.\nNote Please be aware that this idea of addressing missingness in a data set is a multifaceted issue, there is a lot that is not covered here, and in practice it is very easy to go down a rabbit hole. This walkthrough is written in a way that hopefully brings a high level topic down to an understandable level. In doing that, some information is lost or has been set aside for the sake of simplicity. With that said, view this through the lens of a problem that you might or will even likely come across. The issue is that few people know what to do about missing data so they either ignore or delete it without considering the ramifications. However if you are interested in learning more or need clarifications, please reach out!\n  Assumptions If you have taken statistics in the past, then you likely know about these things called assumptions, or criteria that have to be satisfied before running a statistical test (e.g. t-test, ANOVA, etc.). This is also true when dealing with missing data points, in that we have to determine if our data is\n   Type  Shorthand  Description  Traits  What Can You Do?      Missing Completely At Random  MCAR  The locations of missing values are random and not dependent on other data.  Strong assumptions; difficult or possibly impossible to detect  Deletion techniques or imputation with confidence in reporting    Missing At Random  MAR  The locations of missing values are random BUT depend on some other observed data  Neutral(ish) assumptions; possible to detect  Advanced imputation with caution in reporting.    Missing Not At Random  MNAR  There is a pattern to the missing values  Weak assumptions; easy to detect  An inability to report anything meaningful (get new or more data because this is bad).       What to Do About Missing Data In the real world, data involving humans is rarely results in a complete set of values. As you can imagine, this is nearly always the case when conducting surveys where respondents are free to skip questions2. So what can you do?\nTesting for MCAR While it is difficult, if not impossible to figure out if a dataset is MCAR, we can use probability to determine if it could be. The best way to do this is to figure out a formula for the regression, and to test that - but we’re not going to take that approach given the makeup of the course. A simpler, yet less robust way is to use a technique developed by Little (1988) that basically gives is a probability that a data set is MCAR. But remember, there is always an associated probability that it may not be too!\nUsing the narniar package, we can use the test. For those of you who have had a basic statistics course, the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) is that the data is MCAR while the test statistic is a chi-squared (\\(\\chi^2\\)) value.\nmcar_test(nerdy_data) ## # A tibble: 1 x 4 ## statistic df p.value missing.patterns ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; ## 1 90.0 169 1.00 10 Given the high \\(p\\)-value, we can say that nerdy_data may be MCAR. To get an idea of the number of items that have missing values, you can use\nn_var_miss(nerdy_data) ## [1] 26 To view the missingness by item, we can use the following\ngg_miss_var(nerdy_data) which just says all 26 columns have at least one missing value. To see common missingness by items, we can use\ngg_miss_upset(nerdy_data, nsets = n_var_miss(nerdy_data)) where nsets are the number of columns which shows us\n all of the variables with missing values all of the common values that are missing each combination of missing values occurs once  but that is really difficult to read and we’re just getting a feel for the missingness, so let’s try limiting the number of variables to say the top 5\ngg_miss_upset(nerdy_data, nsets = 5) OK that’s better! Now its easier to see questions 15, 22, and 23 share a common missing value and so forth.\nWe can even use ggplot to visualize this differently by item. First we have to add a column for the respondents by\nnerdy_data_rowid \u0026lt;- nerdy_data %\u0026gt;% rowid_to_column(\u0026quot;respondent\u0026quot;) which just adds a column in front with unique ids.\nnerdy_data_rowid ## # A tibble: 10 x 27 ## respondent Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8 Q9 Q10 Q11 ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 1 3 5 3 3 5 5 5 NA NA 5 4 ## 2 2 NA NA 4 3 5 NA 5 1 4 NA 1 ## 3 3 5 NA 5 5 5 NA 5 5 5 5 5 ## 4 4 NA 5 NA 5 5 NA 5 NA 5 5 5 ## 5 5 4 NA NA 4 NA 4 NA 4 4 5 4 ## 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 3 NA NA 4 ## 7 7 5 3 4 3 NA 4 4 NA 5 NA 3 ## 8 8 NA 3 4 5 5 3 NA 5 3 5 4 ## 9 9 NA 5 5 NA 2 3 0 NA 4 4 NA ## 10 10 4 5 5 5 4 3 5 4 4 5 1 ## # … with 15 more variables: Q12 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Q13 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Q14 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Q15 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # Q16 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Q17 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Q18 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Q19 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Q20 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Q21 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # Q22 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Q23 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Q24 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Q25 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Q26 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; And then let’s visualize it for Q1\nggplot(data = nerdy_data_rowid, aes(x = respondent, y = Q1)) + geom_miss_point() or maybe its easier without the default grey background and bigger\nggplot(data = nerdy_data_rowid, aes(x = respondent, y = Q1)) + geom_miss_point(size = 2) + theme_minimal() On a side note, yes the x-axis looks odd and we could fix it, but we’re just exploring.\n Multiple Imputation Run the command mice() from the aptly named mice package to impute a data set.

You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\nRStudio.cloud R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free RStudio.cloud service initially, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.\nGo to https://rstudio.cloud/ and create an account. You’ll receive a link to join the shared class workspace separately. If you don’t get this link, let me know and I will invite you.\n RStudio on your computer RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since RStudio.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica.\nHere’s how you install all these things\nInstall R First you need to install R itself (the engine).\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\n Click on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n If you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (as of this writing, it’s R-4.0.3.pkg; as of right now but download the most current version.\n If you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n  Double click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n If you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n   Install RStudio Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\n The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n  Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n Install tidyverse R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n   It’s a goofy name, but CRAN is where most R packages—and R itself—lives.↩︎\n   ","date":1594771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594771200,"objectID":"86f1654d0114d88986a69932d4d656ee","permalink":"https://edp611.asocialdatascientist.com/resources/install/","publishdate":"2020-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/install/","section":"resources","summary":"RStudio.cloud RStudio on your computer  Install R Install RStudio Install tidyverse    You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!","tags":null,"title":"Installing R, RStudio, and tidyverse","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   While there is no specific rubric, here is a basic outline of what to be looking out for in each task.

You can then use a converter program like pandoc to convert Markdown into whatever format you want: HTML, PDF, Word, PowerPoint, etc. (see the full list of output types here)\nBasic Markdown formatting     Type… …or… …to get    Some text in a paragraph. More text in the next paragraph. Always use empty lines between paragraphs.  Some text in a paragraph.\nMore text in the next paragraph.

There are like a billion little options and features available for math equations—you can find helpful examples of the the most common basic commands here.\nYou can use math in two different ways: inline or in a display block. To use math inline, wrap it in single dollar signs, like $y = mx + b$:\n    Type… …to get    Based on the DAG, the regression model for estimating the effect of education on wages is $\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon$, or $\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon$. Based on the DAG, the regression model for estimating the effect of education on wages is \\(\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon\\), or \\(\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon\\).    To put an equation on its own line in a display block, wrap it in double dollar signs, like this:\nType…\nThe quadratic equation was an important part of high school math: $$ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$ But now we just use computers to solve for $x$. …to get…\n The quadratic equation was an important part of high school math:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\nBut now we just use computers to solve for \\(x\\).\n Because dollar signs are used to indicate math equations, you can’t just use dollar signs like normal if you’re writing about actual dollars. For instance, if you write This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40, Markdown will treat everything that comes between the dollar signs as math, like so: “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\nTo get around that, put a backslash (\\) in front of the dollar signs, so that This book costs \\$5.75 and this other costs \\$40 becomes “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\n Tables There are 4 different ways to hand-create tables in Markdown—I say “hand-create” because it’s normally way easier to use R to generate these things with packages like pander (use pandoc.table()) or knitr (use kable()). The two most common are simple tables and pipe tables. You should look at the full documentation here.\nFor simple tables, type…\n Right Left Center Default ------- ------ ---------- ------- 12 12 12 12 123 123 123 123 1 1 1 1 Table: Caption goes here …to get…\n Caption goes here  Right Left Center Default    12 12 12 12  123 123 123 123  1 1 1 1    For pipe tables, type…\n| Right | Left | Default | Center | |------:|:-----|---------|:------:| | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | | 123 | 123 | 123 | 123 | | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Table: Caption goes here …to get…\n Caption goes here  Right Left Default Center    12 12 12 12  123 123 123 123  1 1 1 1     Footnotes There are two different ways to add footnotes (see here for complete documentation): regular and inline.\nRegular notes need (1) an identifier and (2) the actual note. The identifier can be whatever you want. Some people like to use numbers like [^1], but if you ever rearrange paragraphs or add notes before #1, the numbering will be wrong (in your Markdown file, not in the output; everything will be correct in the output). Because of that, I prefer to use some sort of text label:\nType…\nHere is a footnote reference[^1] and here is another [^note-on-dags]. [^1]: This is a note. [^note-on-dags]: DAGs are neat. And here\u0026#39;s more of the document. …to get…\n Here is a footnote reference1 and here is another.2\nAnd here’s more of the document.\n  This is a note.↩︎   DAGs are neat.↩︎     You can also use inline footnotes with ^[Text of the note goes here], which are often easier because you don’t need to worry about identifiers:\nType…\nCausal inference is neat.^[But it can be hard too!] …to get…\n Causal inference is neat.1\n  But it can be hard too!↩︎      Front matter You can include a special section at the top of a Markdown document that contains metadata (or data about your document) like the title, date, author, etc. This section uses a special simple syntax named YAML (or “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”) that follows this basic outline: setting: value for setting. Here’s an example YAML metadata section. Note that it must start and end with three dashes (---).\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; --- You can put the values inside quotes (like the date and name in the example above), or you can leave them outside of quotes (like the title in the example above). I typically use quotes just to be safe—if the value you’re using has a colon (:) in it, it’ll confuse Markdown since it’ll be something like title: My cool title: a subtitle, which has two colons. It’s better to do this:\n--- title: \u0026quot;My cool title: a subtitle\u0026quot; --- If you want to use quotes inside one of the values (e.g. your document is An evaluation of \"scare quotes\"), you can use single quotes instead:\n--- title: \u0026#39;An evaluation of \u0026quot;scare quotes\u0026quot;\u0026#39; ---  Citations One of the most powerful features of Markdown + pandoc is the ability to automatically cite things and generate bibliographies. to use citations, you need to create a BibTeX file (ends in .bib) that contains a database of the things you want to cite. You can do this with bibliography managers designed to work with BibTeX directly (like BibDesk on macOS), or you can use Zotero (macOS and Windows) to export a .bib file. You can download an example .bib file of all the readings from this class here.\nComplete details for using citations can be found here. In brief, you need to do three things:\nAdd a bibliography: entry to the YAML metadata:\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; bibliography: name_of_file.bib --- Choose a citation style based on a CSL file. The default is Chicago author-date, but you can choose from 2,000+ at this repository. Download the CSL file, put it in your project folder, and add an entry to the YAML metadata (or provide a URL to the online version):\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; bibliography: name_of_file.bib csl: \u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa.csl\u0026quot; --- Some of the most common CSLs are:\n Chicago author-date Chicago note-bibliography Chicago full note-bibliography (no shortened notes or ibids){target=\"_blank\"} APA 7th edition MLA 8th edition  Cite things in your document. Check the documentation for full details of how to do this.

You can create HTML, PDF, and Word documents, PowerPoint and HTML presentations, websites, books, and even interactive dashboards with R Markdown. This whole course website is created with R Markdown (and a package named blogdown).\nThe documentation for R Markdown is extremely comprehensive, and their tutorials and cheatsheets are excellent—rely on those.\nHere are the most important things you’ll need to know about R Markdown in this class:\nKey terms  Document: A Markdown file where you type stuff\n Chunk: A piece of R code that is included in your document. It looks like this:\n```{r} # Code goes here ``` There must be an empty line before and after the chunk. The final three backticks must be the only thing on the line—if you add more text, or if you forget to add the backticks, or accidentally delete the backticks, your document will not knit correctly.\n Knit: When you “knit” a document, R runs each of the chunks sequentially and converts the output of each chunk into Markdown. R then runs the knitted document through pandoc to convert it to HTML or PDF or Word (or whatever output you’ve selected).\nYou can knit by clicking on the “Knit” button at the top of the editor window, or by pressing ⌘⇧K on macOS or control + shift + K on Windows.\n   Add chunks There are three ways to insert chunks:\n Press ⌘⌥I on macOS or control + alt + I on Windows\n Click on the “Insert” button at the top of the editor window\n Manually type all the backticks and curly braces (don’t do this)\n   Chunk names You can add names to chunks to make it easier to navigate your document. If you click on the little dropdown menu at the bottom of your editor in RStudio, you can see a table of contents that shows all the headings and chunks. If you name chunks, they’ll appear in the list. If you don’t include a name, the chunk will still show up, but you won’t know what it does.\nTo add a name, include it immediately after the {r in the first line of the chunk. Names cannot contain spaces, but they can contain underscores and dashes. All chunk names in your document must be unique.\n```{r name-of-this-chunk} # Code goes here ```  Chunk options There are a bunch of different options you can set for each chunk. You can see a complete list in the RMarkdown Reference Guide or at knitr’s website.\nOptions go inside the {r} section of the chunk:\n```{r name-of-this-chunk, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE} # Code goes here ``` The most common chunk options are these:\n fig.width=5 and fig.height=3 (or whatever number you want): Set the dimensions for figures echo=FALSE: The code is not shown in the final document, but the results are message=FALSE: Any messages that R generates (like all the notes that appear after you load a package) are omitted warning=FALSE: Any warnings that R generates are omitted include=FALSE: The chunk still runs, but the code and results are not included in the final document  You can also set chunk options by clicking on the little gear icon in the top right corner of any chunk:\n Inline chunks You can also include R output directly in your text, which is really helpful if you want to report numbers from your analysis. To do this, use `r r_code_here`.\nIt’s generally easiest to calculate numbers in a regular chunk beforehand and then use an inline chunk to display the value in your text. For instance, this document…\n```{r find-avg-mpg, echo=FALSE} avg_mpg \u0026lt;- mean(mtcars$mpg) ``` The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was `r round(avg_mpg, 1)` miles per gallon. … would knit into this:\n The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was 20.1 miles per gallon.\n  Output formats You can specify what kind of document you create when you knit in the YAML front matter.\ntitle: \u0026quot;My document\u0026quot; output: html_document: default pdf_document: default word_document: default You can also click on the down arrow on the “Knit” button to choose the output and generate the appropriate YAML. If you click on the gear icon next to the “Knit” button and choose “Output options”, you change settings for each specific output type, like default figure dimensions or whether or not a table of contents is included.\nThe first output type listed under output: will be what is generated when you click on the “Knit” button or press the keyboard shortcut (⌘⇧K on macOS; control + shift + K on Windows). If you choose a different output with the “Knit” button menu, that output will be moved to the top of the output section.\nThe indentation of the YAML section matters, especially when you have settings nested under each output type. Here’s what a typical output section might look like:\n--- title: \u0026quot;My document\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;My name\u0026quot; date: \u0026quot;August 19, 2020\u0026quot; output: html_document: toc: yes fig_caption: yes fig_height: 8 fig_width: 10 pdf_document: latex_engine: xelatex # More modern PDF typesetting engine toc: yes word_document: toc: yes fig_caption: yes fig_height: 4 fig_width: 5 ---  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"34712881160d8448b3606651d889c270","permalink":"https://edp611.asocialdatascientist.com/resources/rmarkdown/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/rmarkdown/","section":"resources","summary":"Key terms Add chunks Chunk names Chunk options Inline chunks Output formats   R Markdown is regular Markdown with R code and output sprinkled in.

All of these things will do exactly the same thing:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) filter ( mpg,cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot; ) But you’ll notice that only a few of those iterations (the first three) are easily readable.\nTo help improve readability and make it easier to share code with others, there’s an unofficial style guide for writing R code. It’s fairly short and just has lots of examples of good and bad ways of writing code (naming variables, dealing with long lines, using proper indentation levels, etc.)—you should glance through it some time.\nRStudio has a built-in way of cleaning up your code. Select some code, press ctrl + i (on Windows) or ⌘ + i (on macOS), and R will reformat the code for you. It’s not always perfect, but it’s really helpful for getting indentation right without having to manually hit space a billion times.\n Main style things to pay attention to for this class  Important note: I won’t ever grade you on any of this! If you submit something like filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\"compact\"), I might recommend adding spaces, but it won’t affect your grade or points or anything.\n Spacing  See the “Spacing” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Put spaces after commas (like in regular English):\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg , cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg ,cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg,cty \u0026gt; 10) Put spaces around operators like +, -, \u0026gt;, =, etc.:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt;10) filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt;10) Don’t put spaces around parentheses that are parts of functions:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter (mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter ( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10 )  Long lines  See the “Long lines” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n It’s generally good practice to not have really long lines of code. A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (ew), in RStudio go to “Tools” \u0026gt; “Global Options” \u0026gt; “Code” \u0026gt; “Display” and check the box for “Show margin”. You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this—that’s fine. It’s just good practice to avoid going too far past it.\nYou can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Bad filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;)) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;))  Pipes (%\u0026gt;%) and ggplot layers (+) Put each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the + at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() Put each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the %\u0026gt;% at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  Comments  See the “Comments” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Comments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: #\n# Good #Bad #Bad If the comment is really short (and won’t cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code, separated by at least two spaces (it works with one space, but using a couple can enhance readability):\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group You can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group If the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines. RStudio can do this for you if you go to “Code” \u0026gt; “Reflow comment”\n# Good # Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. # Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house.

However, the first thing you may notice is that given Tableau is a proprietary software, there is severe lack of available free resources as opposed to R1. As opposed to open source softwares, you may have difficulties in locating resources that are not commercially linked and worth an investigation.\nSimilar to how Apple operates, Tableau’s parent company Salesforce tightly controls the ecosystem. However for those who want to avoid coding from the ground up, one of major benefits of the visualization software is that it plays well with R. However even with that capability, the interaction is narrowly defined. It also has the largest commercial footprint of those who prefer to pay for a graphical user interface when rendering data visualizations.\nIf you use Twitter, post Tableau-related questions and concerns using TableauSupport using @TableauSupport.

When you unzip a zipped file, your operating system extracts all the files that are contained inside into a new folder on your computer.\nUnzipping files on macOS is trivial, but unzipping files on Windows can mess you up if you don’t pay careful attention. Here’s a helpful guide to unzipping files on both macOS and Windows.\nUnzipping files on macOS Double click on the downloaded .zip file. macOS will automatically create a new folder with the same name as the .zip file, and all the file’s contents will be inside. Double click on the RStudio Project file (.Rproj) to get started.\n Unzipping files on Windows tl;dr: Right click on the .zip file, select “Extract All…”, and work with the resulting unzipped folder.\nUnlike macOS, Windows does not automatically unzip things for you. If you double click on the .zip file, Windows will show you what’s inside, but it will do so without actually extracting anything. This can be is incredibly confusing! Here’s what it looks like—the only clues that this folder is really a .zip file are that there’s a “Compressed Folder Tools” tab at the top, and there’s a “Ratio” column that shows how much each file is compressed.\nIt is very tempting to try to open files from this view. However, if you do, things will break and you won’t be able to correctly work with any of the files in the zipped folder. If you open the R Project file, for instance, RStudio will point to a bizarre working directory buried deep in some temporary folder:\nYou most likely won’t be able to open any data files or save anything, which will be frustrating.\nInstead, you need to right click on the .zip file and select “Extract All…”:\nThen choose where you want to unzip all the files and click on “Extract”\nYou should then finally have a real folder with all the contents of the zipped file.

Hopefully life will back to normal soon!\n  Course objectives You can measure anything (well mostly) Without a basic understanding of measures, you may not be sitting here today! Measurement is a principle trait and whether it is hard wired, learned, or some combination of both, its absence makes quantitative data impossible to classify. But even in cases where measures are available, how can we know if they are consistent and accurate? Without these checks, instruments such as surveys could never be constructed, much less yield results that could be generalized.\nWhen assessing existing programs, having an ability to test a hypothesis is key in understanding its goals. While evaluation tells us whether a program is producing results or having an effect/impact, (performance) measurement tells us what a program did and how well it did it. In particular, the latter is a necessity and involves collecting and reporting data that can be used to compartmentalize the way a program is being implemented.\nSpecifically, you should be able to:\n assess the credibility and ethics of measurement practices be confident in determining valid and reliable measures have the ability to interpret and report psychometric properties of tests view measurement as a typical step in the evaluative process  By the end of this course, you will hopefully become (1) literate in the connection between data and measurement principles, and (2) a skeptic of every research question or purpose that you come across.\nAdditionally, this class will expose you to R—one of the most popular and in-demand statistical languages. Armed with the foundation of R skills you’ll learn in this class, you’ll know enough to be able to find how to analyze and visualize many outputs based on measures.\n FAQ Is the course content difficult? You’ve probably heard an answer like this before: At times some of the material can be dense. Well that isn’t much of a response. Difficulty is not the issue here since as humans with differing educational background, we will have strengths in some areas more than others. Instead the question is can you identify areas that need strengthened and communicate them? If you can, then you have a good shot at succeeding in this class.\n Is R difficult? Learning R can be especially challenging at first—it’s akin to learning a new language like Spanish or even mathematics. Even experienced R users get frustrated…and so much so that some of us have swear jars. However as silly as it sounds one of the best feelings is to overcome a roadblock. With that said, if you find yourself getting irritated, try the following: take a break, go let some frustration out, sleep, discuss with a peer, etc. If you are at your limit, take a few breaths and contact me!\n What if I find a mistake? Tell me! I strive to be error free but like everyone else, make silly mistakes. This includes grammar and spelling errors as well!\n  Course materials There are four optional texts and two software packages necessary for this course. With that said, you will receive some supplementary materials in the course as well.\nTexts Optional Reference To help minimize costs, we do not have a formal text. However we will rely on the following for readings and reference. All are available through the WVU library WVU library in an online capacity barring the APA 7th edition handbook.\n Balkin, R.

This certainly is not a requirement.\nThere will occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the content page for that session.\n R and RStudio You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language R. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard — R handles all the calculations produces the actual statistics and graphical output, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code. Please note that\nyou do not need to have any programming experience to use R\n R is free, but it can sometimes be a task to install and configure. To make life easier, you can opt to use the free RStudio.cloud service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This is recommended for those of you who do not want to install programs right now but please note that you will most likely have to in the near future.\nThe service is convenient, but please keep in mind that it can be slow and is not designed to handle large data sets or more complicated analysis and graphics. You also cannot customize much with RStudio.cloud. Over the course of the term, you’ll want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud.\nYou can find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.\n  Note: Online help Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and its always the tiny errors in your coding can result in tons of headache. People working in any syntax based software package at any level experience this!\nBut there are multiple resources online to help.\n First you will have access to Data Camp which allows you to relieve professional training that otherwise costs a lot of money. Is it perfect and flashy? Nope but it is interactive and if you pay attention, then R’s initial steep learning curve won’t feel like an uphill battle.\n Second two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q\u0026amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)). I freely admit that StackOverflow has saved me multiple hours of frustration. Just note if you have a syntax or process issue, both sites require you to produce a minimally reproducible example.\n Third using Twitter you can post R-related questions and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.\n Fourth searching for help with R on Google (or another indexed search site) can sometimes be tricky because the program name is,for a lack of a better explanation, a single letter.\n Fifth we have a class chatroom which may be accessed via Slack where you can poise a question. I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond relatively quickly. Ask questions about the readings, exercises, and other course materials. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers and may be able to answer other peoples’ questions too.\n Sixth and lastly you can send items by Slack or email me with questions about content, R or whatever (after giving a graduate student effort of course). Please include the subject header EDP 611 “the title of your email” where the title of your email is given without the quotes. Know that I will not just give you the answer, but am happy to push you in the right direction. If you do email me, please include the following:\n A brief description of the problem and what you have done thus far including the line number of the issue (if applicable). A copy of your data set (if applicable). A copy of your script or Rmarkdown document1 with comments throughout so I know what you’ve tried historically leading up to the issue.   I have a mail filter that will automatically bring your email to a top priority status.2\nYou should absolutely expect to struggle at times, but there is no better and more satisfying feeling than figuring things out for yourself! In the long run, you’re more likely to remember things you’ve figured out rather than those you’ve been shown or told.\n  Tasks and grades You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the tasks page.\n Assignments and Grades You can find up to date descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page.\n   Percent  Task  Location      15  R Training  Data Camp    15  Reflections  Slack    15  R Measurement EDA  eCampus/Slack    15  Check-ins  Zoom    30  Final Proposal Bits3  eCampus/Slack    10  Presentation Bits  eCampus/Slack      \nYour hours Please watch this video:\n   Your hours (formerly known as office hours) are set times dedicated to you the student!4). This means that I will be in my office or at home waiting for you to come by talk to me remotely with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.\nBecause of the pandemic, we cannot meet in person. I can meet you online via Zoom. You can request a meeting through either e-mail or Slack.\n Class conduct and expectations Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up with or stole from other professors:\n Late work: Barring the five main course tasks leading up to the proposal and the proposal itself, past due deliverable will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via eCampus. There are no exceptions to this policy. Please note that I will not accept coursework by email or any other means.\n Participation: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate in class. Engagement is mostly defined by you—if that means commenting and answering questions - great; if it means sitting quietly and being focused - also great; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off - not so great.\n Justifications: On any submission, you must justify any assertion. I don’t know what you know so its your job to provide all of the necessary evidence to convince me that you do know what you say you know. While you’ve probably heard this multiple times over your life, think of it this way: if someone tells you that not only is the Earth flat, the core is actually made out of tiramisu and moscato, the first question you should be asking is what’s your evidence? possibly followed by is the core delicious?.\n Rubrics: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level, I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:\nWhen writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), a rubric isn’t often provided. If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up). Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor. Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!   Technology use: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. We’re all adults5.\n My philosophy:\nJust assume that all submissions are formal and must be submitted with the appropriate use of language, grammar, syntax, etc. and follow standard APA 7th edition formatting guidelines where applicable. People who are easily offended by content, believe their work to be flawless or are generally unable to handle criticism should consider looking at another course. If you want rainbows and ponies, consider another class. If you care about data, fieldwork and learning a highly marketable practice, you’ve come to the right place. There is a great deal of content in this course and you will likely struggle with some at times. Given that, there is also something to be said about the satisfaction a person gets when figuring something out, but nowhere is it written that has to be on your own. You may find that a nudge here or there elicits the same feeling so please reach out for help.    Learning and knowledge during a pandemic When course objectives are written explicitly and clearly, they provide the information you need to figure out what a student should be able to do by the end of a given term. In fact, professors often test your proficiency in an area through multiple assessments such as exams, papers, presentations, etc where you are essentially asked to show us what you have retained - but the ability to retain something doesn’t imply that you know it.\nTo save you from a long philosophical narrative on epistemology, we humans aren’t good at directly evaluating a person’s knowledge within a short timeframe. In fact, we can only assess knowledge using indicators (e.g. exams, homework, projects, etc.) rather than direct measures. So\nif you want to test whether you have retained or know a concept, then try explaining it in a way that a lay person can understand.\n If you’re finding that you are unable to do that, then I will absolutely make whatever reasonable and feasible accommodations I can to help you learn the course material, finish your tasks, and to understand what areas you may need to concentrate on. Under these current pandemic conditions, I try to stay flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations. Furthermore, if you feel like you are behind or not understanding everything, please please please do not stay silent! As I said earlier, drop me a line!\n  Course policies Its pretty simple: Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat. Stay in touch. Be a good human.\n We will also follow WVU’s Code of Conduct.\nThis syllabus reflects a plan for the term but things change and plans change. so deviations may become necessary as we move along during the term. Note that I reserve the right to alter or amend this syllabus and will send notifications if course tasks are affected.\n COVID-19 Statement WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.\nIn a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe the social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines set by the University at all times. While in class, students will sit in assigned seats when applicable and wear the required PPE. Should a student forget to bring the required PPE, PPE will be available in the building for students to acquire. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.\nIf a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes.\nPsychological and Psychiatric Services Life at WVU can be complicated and challenging, especially during a pandemic! You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. Psychological and Psychiatric Services provides free, confidential support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The office is staffed by professional counselors and psychiatrists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students. Please do not hesitate to contact them for assistance—getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n CARE Team If you or anyone you know may be at-risk such as those listed here, please make a CARE referral. You may do so directly at the main WVU CARE TEAM site.\n Lauren’s Promise I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\n Lauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or the Campus Police at 304-293-3136.\nIf you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call/text a private Title IX On-Call Line 304-906-9930.\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at West Virginia University. WVU has instituted procedures to respond to violations of these laws and standards, programs aimed at the prevention of such conduct, and intervention on behalf of the victims.\n Academic Integrity The integrity of the classes offered by any academic institution solidifies the foundation of its mission and cannot be sacrificed to expediency, ignorance, or blatant fraud. Therefore, I will enforce rigorous standards of academic integrity in all aspects and assignments of this course. For the detailed policy of West Virginia University regarding the definitions of acts considered to fall under academic dishonesty and possible ensuing sanctions, please see the West Virginia University Academic Catalog at http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. Should you have any questions about possibly improper research citations or references, or any other activity that may be interpreted as an attempt at academic dishonesty, please see me before the assignment is due to discuss the matter.\n Inclusivity Statement The West Virginia University community is committed to creating and fostering a positive learning and working environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and inclusion.\nIf you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of accommodation in order to participate in this class, please advise me and make appropriate arrangements with the Office of Accessibility Services (304-293-6700).\nFor more information on West Virginia University’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, please see http://diversity.wvu.edu.\n Incomplete Grades Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term. If the instructor agrees, the instructor and the student must negotiate the conditions under which the grade of I will be changed to a letter grade and sign a contract. The date to submit the incomplete work should not be set beyond the last day of class of the following semester. If the student does not complete the terms of contract, then the instructor should submit a grade of F. All incomplete contracts must be filed with the department and Dean’s Office. See the policy at [Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term.

Please review the sharing and editing restrictions prior to distributing or amending any material on this site. As such, the unauthorized purchase or sale of these materials may result in disciplinary sanctions under the Campus Student Code. Basically you can share what you like but don’t try to make a buck.\n Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI) Effective teaching is a primary mission of West Virginia University. Student evaluation of instruction provides the university and the instructor with feedback about your experiences in the course for review and course improvement. Your participation in the evaluation of course instruction is both strongly encouraged and highly valued. Results are strictly confidential, anonymous, and not available to the instructor until after final grades are released by Admissions and Records. Information about how you can complete this evaluation will be provided later.\n University Attendance Policy At West Virginia University, class attendance contributes significantly to academic success. Students who attend classes regularly tend to earn higher grades and have higher passing rates in courses. Excessive absences may jeopardize students’ grades or even their ability to continue in their courses. There is a strong correlation between regular class attendance and academic success.\n Course Netiquette The basic premise is that the etiquette expected of students in the online environment is the same as that expected in a classroom. Common courtesy is the guiding rule of Internet communications. Be prepared to communicate effectively when taking an online course. Following these simple netiquette rules in your online class or education environment will ensure your success:\n Include a professional salutation. In this case, “Hello Dr. Roy” or “Dear Dr. Roy” is appropriate. Include a proper ending such as “Thank you” or “With regards.” Then type in your full name. Never type in ALL CAPS, because it reads as if you ARE SHOUTING AT PEOPLE. Act as professionally, via your writing, as you would in a face to face classroom. Refrain from inappropriate language and derogatory or personal attacks. Do not dominate any discussion. Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion. Disagree with ideas but avoid challenges that may be interpreted as a personal attack. Check that you are replying to the specific person you intend, and not to the entire class. Never give your password to another person. Respect the virtual classroom. Never forward in-class communications or posts by others outside of this virtual space. Never spam your classmates. If you quote someone’s previous post, only quote enough to make your point.  Be aware of the University’s Academic Integrity and Dishonesty Policy http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. You can review the rules, regulations, and procedures concerning student conduct and discipline for the main campus of West Virginia University, at http://campuslife.wvu.edu/r/download/1802350.\n Response Time I generally respond to Slack queries in the same day while responses to emails and discussion posts are within 48 hours, except during holidays. Often, I will reply much more quickly but you should not count on a immediate. Please plan accordingly so that you don’t miss deadlines! I generally return assignments within one to two weeks after a final submission date.\n Technical Requirements Students need to have access to a computer for word processing, e-mail and access to eCampus. Access to the Internet is necessary for completion of this course. Run the Browser Check. This tool will check that you are using a supported Internet browser and have a valid Java version installed. The required technical skills to participate in this course are:\nNavigate the web Use email with attachments Create and submit files in commonly used word processing program formats Copy and paste Download and install software Consult software tutorials and other online sources as a method of learning software features Use syntax when necessary  Notice that programming is not on here!\n Technical Support Technical support regarding your use of eCampus is available by contacting 304-293-4444 (telephone), 1-877-327-9260 (toll free number), itshelp@mail.wvu.edu (email), and/or http://it.wvu.edu (website).\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n   Please do not send a screenshot because neither R or I can run a picture of syntax.↩︎\n In this new normal, I receive an overwhelming number of emails per day and may miss yours if the header is not formatted properly.↩︎\n For more information, please check the Tasks page↩︎\n There is some misunderstanding about what office hours actually are!
