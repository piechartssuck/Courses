If you try to complete everything in one sitting, it will probably be overwhelming! However if you have familiarity with some modules, please feel free to work ahead.\n Grading The ultimate point of Data Camp is to get you familiarized with an environment that you likely have never seen or been exposed to. While you should absolutely go through each module, there is certainly no expectation that you will get everything right. In fact, the points that you incur don’t mean anything as far as how you are assessed so please use hints as needed! As with any things data science, you’ll learn by doing. If you are a polar personality type when it comes to work (i.e. primarily a perfectionist or mostly careless), then the modules will likely prove to be a challenge. It is highly unlikely that you will be able to comprehend everything by going beyond your limit or that it will just come to you so please work hard but also take breaks, swear2, and ask peers or me for help. Your score is predicated on putting in a solid effort, rather than getting it right because there is no such thing in data science.\n Data Camp Schedule A tentative schedule is given below.

Final proposal Throughout the course, you will have weekly opportunities to expand and refine your skill set culminating in the development of an instrument which will serve as a final project1.\n  Week 1: Think about assessment.   Construct a one paragraph case for a population2 that needs to be researched, why it should be be studied, and how the data would be quantitative.   \n  Week 2: Create an argument.   Submit a one to three page proposal outlining specific questions that you would like to assess and then describe an instrument that would be used to assess those items. Include general details on what measures would be used.   \n  Week 3. Develop a draft.   Create a draft of your instrument3 by whatever medium you choose and then derive a skeleton. Map the measures directly to the items and group them if possible.   \n  Week 4. Refine the draft.   Based on feedback, amend the instrument if necessary and resubmit for further assessment. Explicitly detail what changes were made using a matrix. After approval, administer the instrument for pilot testing.   \n  Week 5. Address a priori and post analyses.   Submit a one to three page with a description of what approaches were used to assess validity and reliability, and all corresponding data and analyses by csv and an R script, respectively.   \n  Week 6. Refine and submit final instrument.   After amending, submit the final version of your instrument.   Need Help?

You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\nRStudio.cloud R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free RStudio.cloud service initially, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.\nGo to https://rstudio.cloud/ and create an account. You’ll receive a link to join the shared class workspace separately. If you don’t get this link, let me know and I will invite you.\n RStudio on your computer RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since RStudio.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica.\nHere’s how you install all these things\nInstall R First you need to install R itself (the engine).\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\n Click on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n If you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (as of this writing, it’s R-4.0.3.pkg; as of right now but download the most current version.\n If you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n  Double click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n If you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n   Install RStudio Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\n The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n  Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n Install tidyverse R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n   It’s a goofy name, but CRAN is where most R packages—and R itself—lives.↩︎\n   ","date":1594771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594771200,"objectID":"86f1654d0114d88986a69932d4d656ee","permalink":"https://edp611.asocialdatascientist.com/resources/install/","publishdate":"2020-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/install/","section":"resources","summary":"RStudio.cloud RStudio on your computer  Install R Install RStudio Install tidyverse    You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!","tags":null,"title":"Installing R, RStudio, and tidyverse","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   While there is no specific rubric, here is a basic outline of what to be looking out for in each task.

You can then use a converter program like pandoc to convert Markdown into whatever format you want: HTML, PDF, Word, PowerPoint, etc. (see the full list of output types here)\nBasic Markdown formatting     Type… …or… …to get    Some text in a paragraph.

There are like a billion little options and features available for math equations—you can find helpful examples of the the most common basic commands here.\nYou can use math in two different ways: inline or in a display block. To use math inline, wrap it in single dollar signs, like $y = mx + b$:\n    Type… …to get    Based on the DAG, the regression model for estimating the effect of education on wages is $\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon$, or $\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon$. Based on the DAG, the regression model for estimating the effect of education on wages is \\(\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon\\), or \\(\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon\\).    To put an equation on its own line in a display block, wrap it in double dollar signs, like this:\nType…\nThe quadratic equation was an important part of high school math: $$ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$ But now we just use computers to solve for $x$. …to get…\n The quadratic equation was an important part of high school math:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\nBut now we just use computers to solve for \\(x\\).\n Because dollar signs are used to indicate math equations, you can’t just use dollar signs like normal if you’re writing about actual dollars. For instance, if you write This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40, Markdown will treat everything that comes between the dollar signs as math, like so: “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\nTo get around that, put a backslash (\\) in front of the dollar signs, so that This book costs \\$5.75 and this other costs \\$40 becomes “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\n Tables There are 4 different ways to hand-create tables in Markdown—I say “hand-create” because it’s normally way easier to use R to generate these things with packages like pander (use pandoc.table()) or knitr (use kable()). The two most common are simple tables and pipe tables. You should look at the full documentation here.\nFor simple tables, type…\n Right Left Center Default ------- ------ ---------- ------- 12 12 12 12 123 123 123 123 1 1 1 1 Table: Caption goes here …to get…\n Caption goes here  Right Left Center Default    12 12 12 12  123 123 123 123  1 1 1 1    For pipe tables, type…\n| Right | Left | Default | Center | |------:|:-----|---------|:------:| | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | | 123 | 123 | 123 | 123 | | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Table: Caption goes here …to get…\n Caption goes here  Right Left Default Center    12 12 12 12  123 123 123 123  1 1 1 1     Footnotes There are two different ways to add footnotes (see here for complete documentation): regular and inline.\nRegular notes need (1) an identifier and (2) the actual note. The identifier can be whatever you want. Some people like to use numbers like [^1], but if you ever rearrange paragraphs or add notes before #1, the numbering will be wrong (in your Markdown file, not in the output; everything will be correct in the output). Because of that, I prefer to use some sort of text label:\nType…\nHere is a footnote reference[^1] and here is another [^note-on-dags]. [^1]: This is a note. [^note-on-dags]: DAGs are neat. And here\u0026#39;s more of the document. …to get…\n Here is a footnote reference1 and here is another.2\nAnd here’s more of the document.\n  This is a note.↩︎   DAGs are neat.↩︎     You can also use inline footnotes with ^[Text of the note goes here], which are often easier because you don’t need to worry about identifiers:\nType…\nCausal inference is neat.^[But it can be hard too!] …to get…\n Causal inference is neat.1\n  But it can be hard too!↩︎      Front matter You can include a special section at the top of a Markdown document that contains metadata (or data about your document) like the title, date, author, etc. This section uses a special simple syntax named YAML (or “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”) that follows this basic outline: setting: value for setting. Here’s an example YAML metadata section. Note that it must start and end with three dashes (---).\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; --- You can put the values inside quotes (like the date and name in the example above), or you can leave them outside of quotes (like the title in the example above). I typically use quotes just to be safe—if the value you’re using has a colon (:) in it, it’ll confuse Markdown since it’ll be something like title: My cool title: a subtitle, which has two colons. It’s better to do this:\n--- title: \u0026quot;My cool title: a subtitle\u0026quot; --- If you want to use quotes inside one of the values (e.g. your document is An evaluation of \"scare quotes\"), you can use single quotes instead:\n--- title: \u0026#39;An evaluation of \u0026quot;scare quotes\u0026quot;\u0026#39; ---  Citations One of the most powerful features of Markdown + pandoc is the ability to automatically cite things and generate bibliographies. to use citations, you need to create a BibTeX file (ends in .bib) that contains a database of the things you want to cite. You can do this with bibliography managers designed to work with BibTeX directly (like BibDesk on macOS), or you can use Zotero (macOS and Windows) to export a .bib file. You can download an example .bib file of all the readings from this class here.\nComplete details for using citations can be found here. In brief, you need to do three things:\nAdd a bibliography: entry to the YAML metadata:\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; bibliography: name_of_file.bib --- Choose a citation style based on a CSL file. The default is Chicago author-date, but you can choose from 2,000+ at this repository. Download the CSL file, put it in your project folder, and add an entry to the YAML metadata (or provide a URL to the online version):\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; bibliography: name_of_file.bib csl: \u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa.csl\u0026quot; --- Some of the most common CSLs are:\n Chicago author-date Chicago note-bibliography Chicago full note-bibliography (no shortened notes or ibids){target=\"_blank\"} APA 7th edition MLA 8th edition  Cite things in your document. Check the documentation for full details of how to do this. Essentially, you use @citationkey inside square brackets ([]):\n    Type… …to get…    Causal inference is neat [@Rohrer:2018; @AngristPischke:2015].

Teacup Giraffes: A fantastic and visually stunning way to learn R using animations accessible to children but for adults by Dr. Desirée De Leon at RStudio.   R in the Wild A popular (and increasingly standard) way for sharing your analyses and visualizations is to post an annotated explanation of your process somewhere online. RStudio allows you to publish knitted HTML files directly to RPubs, but you can also post your output to a blog or other type of website.1 Reading these kinds of posts is one of the best ways to learn R, since they walk you through each step of the process and show the code and output.\n Sample of R Visualizations  Bob Ross - Joy of Painting Bechdel analysis using the tidyverse: There are also a bunch of other examples using data from FiveThirtyEight Comparison of Quentin Tarantino Movies by Box Office and the Bechdel Test A decade(ish) of listening to Sigur Rós Disproving Approval R color Palettes by Emil Hvitfeldt is a very comprehensive list of pre packaged color palettes you can get.

You can do everything you can with regular Markdown, but you can incorporate graphs, tables, and other R output directly in your document. You can create HTML, PDF, and Word documents, PowerPoint and HTML presentations, websites, books, and even interactive dashboards with R Markdown. This whole course website is created with R Markdown (and a package named blogdown).\nThe documentation for R Markdown is extremely comprehensive, and their tutorials and cheatsheets are excellent—rely on those.\nHere are the most important things you’ll need to know about R Markdown in this class:\nKey terms  Document: A Markdown file where you type stuff\n Chunk: A piece of R code that is included in your document. It looks like this:\n```{r} # Code goes here ``` There must be an empty line before and after the chunk. The final three backticks must be the only thing on the line—if you add more text, or if you forget to add the backticks, or accidentally delete the backticks, your document will not knit correctly.\n Knit: When you “knit” a document, R runs each of the chunks sequentially and converts the output of each chunk into Markdown. R then runs the knitted document through pandoc to convert it to HTML or PDF or Word (or whatever output you’ve selected).\nYou can knit by clicking on the “Knit” button at the top of the editor window, or by pressing ⌘⇧K on macOS or control + shift + K on Windows.\n   Add chunks There are three ways to insert chunks:\n Press ⌘⌥I on macOS or control + alt + I on Windows\n Click on the “Insert” button at the top of the editor window\n Manually type all the backticks and curly braces (don’t do this)\n   Chunk names You can add names to chunks to make it easier to navigate your document. If you click on the little dropdown menu at the bottom of your editor in RStudio, you can see a table of contents that shows all the headings and chunks. If you name chunks, they’ll appear in the list. If you don’t include a name, the chunk will still show up, but you won’t know what it does.\nTo add a name, include it immediately after the {r in the first line of the chunk. Names cannot contain spaces, but they can contain underscores and dashes. All chunk names in your document must be unique.\n```{r name-of-this-chunk} # Code goes here ```  Chunk options There are a bunch of different options you can set for each chunk. You can see a complete list in the RMarkdown Reference Guide or at knitr’s website.\nOptions go inside the {r} section of the chunk:\n```{r name-of-this-chunk, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE} # Code goes here ``` The most common chunk options are these:\n fig.width=5 and fig.height=3 (or whatever number you want): Set the dimensions for figures echo=FALSE: The code is not shown in the final document, but the results are message=FALSE: Any messages that R generates (like all the notes that appear after you load a package) are omitted warning=FALSE: Any warnings that R generates are omitted include=FALSE: The chunk still runs, but the code and results are not included in the final document  You can also set chunk options by clicking on the little gear icon in the top right corner of any chunk:\n Inline chunks You can also include R output directly in your text, which is really helpful if you want to report numbers from your analysis. To do this, use `r r_code_here`.\nIt’s generally easiest to calculate numbers in a regular chunk beforehand and then use an inline chunk to display the value in your text. For instance, this document…\n```{r find-avg-mpg, echo=FALSE} avg_mpg \u0026lt;- mean(mtcars$mpg) ``` The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was `r round(avg_mpg, 1)` miles per gallon. … would knit into this:\n The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was 20.1 miles per gallon.\n  Output formats You can specify what kind of document you create when you knit in the YAML front matter.\ntitle: \u0026quot;My document\u0026quot; output: html_document: default pdf_document: default word_document: default You can also click on the down arrow on the “Knit” button to choose the output and generate the appropriate YAML. If you click on the gear icon next to the “Knit” button and choose “Output options”, you change settings for each specific output type, like default figure dimensions or whether or not a table of contents is included.\nThe first output type listed under output: will be what is generated when you click on the “Knit” button or press the keyboard shortcut (⌘⇧K on macOS; control + shift + K on Windows). If you choose a different output with the “Knit” button menu, that output will be moved to the top of the output section.\nThe indentation of the YAML section matters, especially when you have settings nested under each output type. Here’s what a typical output section might look like:\n--- title: \u0026quot;My document\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;My name\u0026quot; date: \u0026quot;August 19, 2020\u0026quot; output: html_document: toc: yes fig_caption: yes fig_height: 8 fig_width: 10 pdf_document: latex_engine: xelatex # More modern PDF typesetting engine toc: yes word_document: toc: yes fig_caption: yes fig_height: 4 fig_width: 5 ---  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"34712881160d8448b3606651d889c270","permalink":"https://edp611.asocialdatascientist.com/resources/rmarkdown/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/rmarkdown/","section":"resources","summary":"Key terms Add chunks Chunk names Chunk options Inline chunks Output formats   R Markdown is regular Markdown with R code and output sprinkled in.

All of these things will do exactly the same thing:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) filter ( mpg,cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot; ) But you’ll notice that only a few of those iterations (the first three) are easily readable.\nTo help improve readability and make it easier to share code with others, there’s an unofficial style guide for writing R code. It’s fairly short and just has lots of examples of good and bad ways of writing code (naming variables, dealing with long lines, using proper indentation levels, etc.)—you should glance through it some time.\nRStudio has a built-in way of cleaning up your code. Select some code, press ctrl + i (on Windows) or ⌘ + i (on macOS), and R will reformat the code for you. It’s not always perfect, but it’s really helpful for getting indentation right without having to manually hit space a billion times.\n Main style things to pay attention to for this class  Important note: I won’t ever grade you on any of this! If you submit something like filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\"compact\"), I might recommend adding spaces, but it won’t affect your grade or points or anything.\n Spacing  See the “Spacing” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Put spaces after commas (like in regular English):\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg , cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg ,cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg,cty \u0026gt; 10) Put spaces around operators like +, -, \u0026gt;, =, etc.:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt;10) filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt;10) Don’t put spaces around parentheses that are parts of functions:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter (mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter ( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10 )  Long lines  See the “Long lines” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n It’s generally good practice to not have really long lines of code. A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (ew), in RStudio go to “Tools” \u0026gt; “Global Options” \u0026gt; “Code” \u0026gt; “Display” and check the box for “Show margin”. You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this—that’s fine. It’s just good practice to avoid going too far past it.\nYou can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Bad filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;)) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;))  Pipes (%\u0026gt;%) and ggplot layers (+) Put each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the + at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() Put each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the %\u0026gt;% at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  Comments  See the “Comments” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Comments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: #\n# Good #Bad #Bad If the comment is really short (and won’t cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code, separated by at least two spaces (it works with one space, but using a couple can enhance readability):\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group You can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group If the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines. RStudio can do this for you if you go to “Code” \u0026gt; “Reflow comment”\n# Good # Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. # Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house.

As opposed to open source softwares, you may have difficulties in locating resources that are not commercially linked and worth an investigation.\nSimilar to how Apple operates, Tableau’s parent company Salesforce tightly controls the ecosystem. However for those who want to avoid coding from the ground up, one of major benefits of the visualization software is that it plays well with R. However even with that capability, the interaction is narrowly defined. It also has the largest commercial footprint of those who prefer to pay for a graphical user interface when rendering data visualizations.\nIf you use Twitter, post Tableau-related questions and concerns using TableauSupport using @TableauSupport.

When you unzip a zipped file, your operating system extracts all the files that are contained inside into a new folder on your computer.\nUnzipping files on macOS is trivial, but unzipping files on Windows can mess you up if you don’t pay careful attention. Here’s a helpful guide to unzipping files on both macOS and Windows.\nUnzipping files on macOS Double click on the downloaded .zip file. macOS will automatically create a new folder with the same name as the .zip file, and all the file’s contents will be inside. Double click on the RStudio Project file (.Rproj) to get started.\n Unzipping files on Windows tl;dr: Right click on the .zip file, select “Extract All…”, and work with the resulting unzipped folder.\nUnlike macOS, Windows does not automatically unzip things for you. If you double click on the .zip file, Windows will show you what’s inside, but it will do so without actually extracting anything. This can be is incredibly confusing! Here’s what it looks like—the only clues that this folder is really a .zip file are that there’s a “Compressed Folder Tools” tab at the top, and there’s a “Ratio” column that shows how much each file is compressed.\nIt is very tempting to try to open files from this view. However, if you do, things will break and you won’t be able to correctly work with any of the files in the zipped folder. If you open the R Project file, for instance, RStudio will point to a bizarre working directory buried deep in some temporary folder:\nYou most likely won’t be able to open any data files or save anything, which will be frustrating.\nInstead, you need to right click on the .zip file and select “Extract All…”:\nThen choose where you want to unzip all the files and click on “Extract”\nYou should then finally have a real folder with all the contents of the zipped file.

Response times are typically much quicker than the standard 24-48 hours given to emails. Hopefully life will back to normal soon!\n  Course objectives You can measure anything (well mostly) Without a basic understanding of measures, you may not be sitting here today! Measurement is a principle trait and whether it is hard wired, learned, or some combination of both, its absence makes quantitative data impossible to classify. But even in cases where measures are available, how can we know if they are consistent and accurate? Without these checks, instruments such as surveys could never be constructed, much less yield results that could be generalized.\nWhen assessing existing programs, having an ability to test a hypothesis is key in understanding its goals. While evaluation tells us whether a program is producing results or having an effect/impact, (performance) measurement tells us what a program did and how well it did it. In particular, the latter is a necessity and involves collecting and reporting data that can be used to compartmentalize the way a program is being implemented.\nSpecifically, you should be able to:\n assess the credibility and ethics of measurement practices be confident in determining valid and reliable measures have the ability to interpret and report psychometric properties of tests view measurement as a typical step in the evaluative process  By the end of this course, you will hopefully become (1) literate in the connection between data and measurement principles, and (2) a skeptic of every research question or purpose that you come across.\nAdditionally, this class will expose you to R—one of the most popular and in-demand statistical languages. Armed with the foundation of R skills you’ll learn in this class, you’ll know enough to be able to find how to analyze and visualize many outputs based on measures.\n FAQ Is the course content difficult? You’ve probably heard an answer like this before: At times some of the material can be dense. Well that isn’t much of a response. Difficulty is not the issue here since as humans with differing educational background, we will have strengths in some areas more than others. Instead the question is can you identify areas that need strengthened and communicate them? If you can, then you have a good shot at succeeding in this class.\n Is R difficult? Learning R can be especially challenging at first—it’s akin to learning a new language like Spanish or even mathematics. Even experienced R users get frustrated…and so much so that some of us have swear jars. However as silly as it sounds one of the best feelings is to overcome a roadblock. With that said, if you find yourself getting irritated, try the following: take a break, go let some frustration out, sleep, discuss with a peer, etc. If you are at your limit, take a few breaths and contact me!\n What if I find a mistake? Tell me! I strive to be error free but like everyone else, make silly mistakes. This includes grammar and spelling errors as well!\n  Course materials There are four optional texts and two software packages necessary for this course. With that said, you will receive some supplementary materials in the course as well.\nTexts Optional Reference To help minimize costs, we do not have a formal text. However we will rely on the following for readings and reference. All are available through the WVU library WVU library in an online capacity barring the APA 7th edition handbook.\n Balkin, R.

This certainly is not a requirement.\nThere will occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the content page for that session.\n R and RStudio You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language R. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard — R handles all the calculations produces the actual statistics and graphical output, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code. Please note that\nyou do not need to have any programming experience to use R\n R is free, but it can sometimes be a task to install and configure. To make life easier, you can opt to use the free RStudio.cloud service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This is recommended for those of you who do not want to install programs right now but please note that you will most likely have to in the near future.\nThe service is convenient, but please keep in mind that it can be slow and is not designed to handle large data sets or more complicated analysis and graphics. You also cannot customize much with RStudio.cloud. Over the course of the term, you’ll want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud.\nYou can find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.\n  Note: Online help Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and its always the tiny errors in your coding can result in tons of headache. People working in any syntax based software package at any level experience this!\nBut there are multiple resources online to help.\n First you will have access to Data Camp which allows you to relieve professional training that otherwise costs a lot of money. Is it perfect and flashy? Nope but it is interactive and if you pay attention, then R’s initial steep learning curve won’t feel like an uphill battle.\n Second two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q\u0026amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)). I freely admit that StackOverflow has saved me multiple hours of frustration. Just note if you have a syntax or process issue, both sites require you to produce a minimally reproducible example.\n Third using Twitter you can post R-related questions and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.\n Fourth searching for help with R on Google (or another indexed search site) can sometimes be tricky because the program name is,for a lack of a better explanation, a single letter.\n Fifth we have a class chatroom which may be accessed via Slack where you can poise a question. I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond relatively quickly. Ask questions about the readings, exercises, and other course materials. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers and may be able to answer other peoples’ questions too.\n Sixth and lastly you can send items by Slack or email me with questions about content, R or whatever (after giving a graduate student effort of course). Please include the subject header EDP 611 “the title of your email” where the title of your email is given without the quotes. Know that I will not just give you the answer, but am happy to push you in the right direction. If you do email me, please include the following:\n A brief description of the problem and what you have done thus far including the line number of the issue (if applicable). A copy of your data set (if applicable). A copy of your script or Rmarkdown document1 with comments throughout so I know what you’ve tried historically leading up to the issue.   I have a mail filter that will automatically bring your email to a top priority status.2\nYou should absolutely expect to struggle at times, but there is no better and more satisfying feeling than figuring things out for yourself! In the long run, you’re more likely to remember things you’ve figured out rather than those you’ve been shown or told.\n  Tasks and grades You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the tasks page.\n Assignments and Grades You can find up to date descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page.\n   Percent  Task  Location      15  R Training  Data Camp    15  Reflections  Slack Channel    15  R Measurement Task  eCampus/Slack    15  Synchronous Meetings  Zoom    30  Final Proposal  eCampus/Slack    10  Presentation of Proposal  eCampus/Slack      \nYour hours Please watch this video:\n   Your hours (formerly known as office hours) are set times dedicated to you the student!3). This means that I will be in my office at home waiting for you to come by talk to me remotely with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.\nBecause of the pandemic, we cannot meet in person. I can meet you online via Zoom. You can request a meeting through either e-mail or Slack.\n Class conduct and expectations Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up with or stole from other professors:\n Late work: Barring the three main course tasks, past due deliverables will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via eCampus. There are no exceptions to this policy. Please note that I will not accept coursework by email or any other means.\n Participation: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate in class. Engagement is mostly defined by you—if that means commenting and answering questions, neat; if it means sitting quietly and being focused, also neat; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off, not so neat.\n Justifications: On any submission, you must justiofy any assertion. I don’t know what you know so its your job to provide all of the necessary evidence to convince me that you do know what you say you know. While you’ve probably heard this multiple times over your life, think of it this way: if someone tells you that not only is the Earth flat, the core is actually made out of tiramisu and moscato, the first question you should be asking is what’s your evidence? possibly followed by is the core delicious?.\n Rubrics: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level, I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:\nWhen writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), a rubric isn’t often provided. If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up). Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor. Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!   Technology use: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. We’re all adults4.\n My philosophy:\nJust assume that all submissions are formal and must be submitted with the appropriate use of language, grammar, syntax, etc. and follow standard APA 7th edition formatting guidelines where applicable. People who are easily offended by content, believe their work to be flawless or are generally unable to handle criticism should consider looking at another course. If you want rainbows and ponies, consider another class. If you care about data, fieldwork and learning a highly marketable practice, you’ve come to the right place. There is a great deal of content in this course and you will likely struggle with some at times. Given that, there is also something to be said about the satisfaction a person gets when figuring something out, but nowhere is it written that has to be on your own. You may find that a nudge here or there elicits the same feeling so please reach out for help.    Learning and knowledge during a pandemic Ok I’m going to get a bit philosophical but it’s not too deep and there’s a point so please bear with me. Let’s first start with something at the top of a syllabus that many people skip - the course objectives. Well now that you’re no doubt excited excited, read the rest this rant to figure out if you have learned something or you actually know it.\nWhen course objectives are written explicitly and clearly, they provide the information you need to figure out what a student should be able to do by the end of a given term. In fact, professors often test your proficiency in an area through multiple assessments such as exams, papers, presentations, etc where you are essentially asked to show us what you have learned. But learning isn’t knowledge.\nTo save you from a long philosophical narrative on epistemology, in a nutshell we humans are not really good at evaluating a person’s knowledge within a short timeframe…oh say like a semester. With that said you probably spend a lot of time with you, so you should be pretty good at knowing if you know something but you may not know how to figure out what you actually know. If your head doesn’t hurt and you really want a good indicator that something you learned has become knowledge, ask this simple question that is often difficult to answer:\nCan I explain whatever using basic everyday language so that a fourth grader can understand it?\n So the fourth grader isn’t that important as much as self assessing if you can explain a concept to someone who lacks any basic understanding using every day language. This is basically what good teachers can do, in that they are able to take a high level concept that may be inaccessible to most of us and bring it down to a level we can all generally understand.\nMany, if not all of you will fall somewhere in the spectrum of somewhat to mostly. If you’re sitting on the absolute Yes end, then consider a career in survey research because it can be very fulfilling and lucrative. But if you find yourself on the absolute No end, then please contact me and let’s try to get you where you need to be. There are a lot of moving parts in this course and not being able to translate some of what you’ve learned into knowledge can have a cascading effect. And by now in your life, you should have a pretty good idea when anyone uses the term cascading, its rarely a good thing.\nOn top of what’s noted above and I’m not sure how to articulate this any better - life just sucks right now in general! You may know people who have lost their jobs, tested positive for COVID-19, been hospitalized, or have even passed away. Additionally your personal responsibilities have probably shifted and for whatever reason or combination thereof, you’re probably more stressed than usual. So here is my promise to you:\nIf you keep an open line, show initiative, and let me know ahead of time if something is going not according to plan5, I will do everything I can to help you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class!\n So what does that mean? Well I will absolutely make whatever reasonable and feasible accommodations I can to help you learn the course material, finish your tasks, and to understand what areas you may need to concentrate on. Under these current pandemic conditions, I try to stay flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations. Furthermore, if you feel like you are behind or not understanding everything, please please please do not stay silent! As I said earlier, drop me a line!\nI selfishly want you to learn lots of things from this class (design! analysis! R! creating visualizations!, no parallel lines exist in 3D - ok maybe not that last one but its true and really easy to show. If you want to know, ask!). There is a lot to do in this course and some of the content can be frustrating, so make sure to take breaks, go relax, even curse my name if you have to - do whatever you need to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.\n  Course policies Its pretty simple: Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat. Stay in touch. Be a good human.\n We will also follow WVU’s Code of Conduct.\nThis syllabus reflects a plan for the term but things change and plans change. so deviations may become necessary as we move along during the term. Note that I reserve the right to alter or amend this syllabus and will send notifications if course tasks are affected.\n COVID-19 Statement WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.\nIn a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe the social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines set by the University at all times. While in class, students will sit in assigned seats when applicable and wear the required PPE. Should a student forget to bring the required PPE, PPE will be available in the building for students to acquire. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.\nIf a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes.\nPsychological and Psychiatric Services Life at WVU can be complicated and challenging, especially during a pandemic! You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. Psychological and Psychiatric Services provides free, confidential support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The office is staffed by professional counselors and psychiatrists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students. Please do not hesitate to contact them for assistance—getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n CARE Team If you or anyone you know may be at-risk such as those listed here, please make a CARE referral. You may do so directly at the main WVU CARE TEAM site.\n Lauren’s Promise I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\n Lauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or the Campus Police at 304-293-3136.\nIf you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call/text a private Title IX On-Call Line 304-906-9930.\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at West Virginia University. WVU has instituted procedures to respond to violations of these laws and standards, programs aimed at the prevention of such conduct, and intervention on behalf of the victims.\n Academic Integrity The integrity of the classes offered by any academic institution solidifies the foundation of its mission and cannot be sacrificed to expediency, ignorance, or blatant fraud. Therefore, I will enforce rigorous standards of academic integrity in all aspects and assignments of this course. For the detailed policy of West Virginia University regarding the definitions of acts considered to fall under academic dishonesty and possible ensuing sanctions, please see the West Virginia University Academic Catalog at http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. Should you have any questions about possibly improper research citations or references, or any other activity that may be interpreted as an attempt at academic dishonesty, please see me before the assignment is due to discuss the matter.\n Inclusivity Statement The West Virginia University community is committed to creating and fostering a positive learning and working environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and inclusion.\nIf you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of accommodation in order to participate in this class, please advise me and make appropriate arrangements with the Office of Accessibility Services (304-293-6700).\nFor more information on West Virginia University’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, please see http://diversity.wvu.edu.\n Incomplete Grades Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term. If the instructor agrees, the instructor and the student must negotiate the conditions under which the grade of I will be changed to a letter grade and sign a contract. The date to submit the incomplete work should not be set beyond the last day of class of the following semester. If the student does not complete the terms of contract, then the instructor should submit a grade of F. All incomplete contracts must be filed with the department and Dean’s Office. See the policy at [Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term.

See the policy at http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/enrollmentandregistration/#gradestext.\n Sale of Course Materials All course materials, including lectures, class notes, quizzes, exams, handouts, presentations, and other materials provided to students for this course are protected under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Please review the sharing and editing restrictions prior to distributing or amending any material on this site. As such, the unauthorized purchase or sale of these materials may result in disciplinary sanctions under the Campus Student Code. Basically you can share what you like but don’t try to make a buck.\n Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI) Effective teaching is a primary mission of West Virginia University. Student evaluation of instruction provides the university and the instructor with feedback about your experiences in the course for review and course improvement. Your participation in the evaluation of course instruction is both strongly encouraged and highly valued. Results are strictly confidential, anonymous, and not available to the instructor until after final grades are released by Admissions and Records. Information about how you can complete this evaluation will be provided later.\n University Attendance Policy At West Virginia University, class attendance contributes significantly to academic success. Students who attend classes regularly tend to earn higher grades and have higher passing rates in courses. Excessive absences may jeopardize students’ grades or even their ability to continue in their courses. There is a strong correlation between regular class attendance and academic success.\n Course Netiquette The basic premise is that the etiquette expected of students in the online environment is the same as that expected in a classroom. Common courtesy is the guiding rule of Internet communications. Be prepared to communicate effectively when taking an online course. Following these simple netiquette rules in your online class or education environment will ensure your success:\n Include a professional salutation. In this case, “Hello Dr. Roy” or “Dear Dr. Roy” is appropriate. Include a proper ending such as “Thank you” or “With regards.” Then type in your full name. Never type in ALL CAPS, because it reads as if you ARE SHOUTING AT PEOPLE. Act as professionally, via your writing, as you would in a face to face classroom. Refrain from inappropriate language and derogatory or personal attacks. Do not dominate any discussion. Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion. Disagree with ideas but avoid challenges that may be interpreted as a personal attack. Check that you are replying to the specific person you intend, and not to the entire class. Never give your password to another person. Respect the virtual classroom. Never forward in-class communications or posts by others outside of this virtual space. Never spam your classmates. If you quote someone’s previous post, only quote enough to make your point.  Be aware of the University’s Academic Integrity and Dishonesty Policy http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. You can review the rules, regulations, and procedures concerning student conduct and discipline for the main campus of West Virginia University, at http://campuslife.wvu.edu/r/download/1802350.\n Response Time I generally respond to Slack queries in the same day while responses to emails and discussion posts are within 48 hours, except during holidays. Often, I will reply much more quickly but you should not count on a immediate. Please plan accordingly so that you don’t miss deadlines! I generally return assignments within one to two weeks after a final submission date.\n Technical Requirements Students need to have access to a computer for word processing, e-mail and access to eCampus. Access to the Internet is necessary for completion of this course. Run the Browser Check. This tool will check that you are using a supported Internet browser and have a valid Java version installed.
