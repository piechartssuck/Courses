This section contains descriptions of course tasks. Materials will be posted on a weekly basis. Please note that these pages populate information about course related tasks on the left hand side when they are assigned. Due dates are given with the description of each assignment.\nKeeping Up There are a lot of moving parts to this class. Students who gain the most out of the course generally follow these general notions:\nEngaging with the readings and materials; Putting in a good faith effort but also asking for help when needed; Keeping a respectful, open, and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.   Evaluation Workgroups You will need to form 2 - 4 member support and project groups. There will be a discussion board where you can discuss available times in your schedules for group chats and there will be a group signup tool in Slack1. Once you have completed sign up, Slack will automatically privatize your group.\n General Course Makeup Weekly Postings I will create discussion boards for a variety of purposes including discussing general course questions / logistics, getting to know each other, getting organized into groups, discussing each assignment, etc. You will need to participate actively on each board and your postings should be meaningful and incorporate depth. Responses without any additional information and/or justifications will be considered to be incomplete and will reflect on your final earned point value. The Slack site will include an assignments section organized by week. Within each week, I will post a description of everything you should complete for that week, including discussion board postings, chat room prompts and scaffolding, readings, and assignments as applicable. In addition to working together in the chat rooms, these groups will also do presentations and an evaluation project together. All members must contribute to all of these activities equitably; all members will receive the same grade on all group assignments. If any challenges or contention arise among group members, please let me know immediately so I can address the issue appropriately.\nThese postings will be graded using a check system:\n ✔+: (11.5 points (115%) in the gradebook) Postings address a topic area completely and arguments are exceptional with plenty of justifications. These are not earned often. ✔: (10 points (100%) in the gradebook) Postings mostly address a topic area completely and/or arguments are on point. This is the expected level of performance. ✔−: (5 points (50%) in the gradebook) Postings generally fail to address a topic area completely and/or arguments are on off-point This is the expected level of performance. This indicates that you need to improve next time. Hopefully people will not earn this often.  Otherwise 0 points (0%) in the gradebook.\n Synchronous Meetings There are two types of meetings in this class: ongoing and check-in. Please see the details below for an explanation of each.\nOngoing You will need to meet weekly in the chat room to discuss your understanding, questions, and challenges with the readings, upcoming assignments, etc. I will provide prompts and scaffolding for your discussions. A one page summary consisting of who attended the meeting, content and general synopsis must submitted to eCampus unless otherwise noted.\n Check-in We will need to meet at least six (6) times over the course of term. the primary purpose of this is not just to get to know you, but also to answer any questions you may have and to get an idea of what areas need to be addressed. My job is to serve as a mentor during your evaluation but that requires you to ask questions and be up to date on the course material. I will be using terminology that has been covered and without a frame of reference, the conversation may be difficult.\n  Evaluation Deliverables There are four primary deliverables in the course. Included below are basic descriptions of each but a full set of criteria for each task will be posted as we progress through the term.\nEvaluation Prospectus A general list and brief descriptions of possible programs to evaluate.\n Needs Assessment After identifying a program, your group will be tasked to conduct at least one interview and/or focus group using an approved medium of the primary stakeholder(s) and/or sponsor(s).\n Evaluation Proposal A full proposal of the anticipated evaluation framework including a discussion of the program, its needs, and intended approach/methods.\n Final Report A stakeholder or sponsor oriented report of the full evaluation process written to be accessible and appropriate for the intended audience.\nDepending on the program you evaluate and on how you end up conceptualizing your evaluation study, these assignments may be modified in order to make them more meaningful and applicable to your needs and interests. Further details may be found the individual task documents. Never hesitate to discuss any issues you have relative to the assignments with me. More about these task will be posted in the following weeks.\n  Presentation of Results This task will involve your group presenting on your evaluation. This will be your way of teaching the class about the program your group chose to evaluate and what you learned from conducting your evaluation project.\n Need Help?

Note that you do not have to use your WVU account, but its not a bad idea. Head to to the channel #introduce-yourself and well introduce yourself by tell everyone about yourself, what you hope to achieve out of this course, and something about you that really defines who you are. For example, here is something about me: I teach data visualization BUT I am also about 40% colorblind! How do I know what color to use? Take EDP 693E: Data Visualization this term to find out! 1 (optional) Provide a picture if you are willing. I am a very visual person as are many other people so pictures help a great deal. However, you are not mandated to do so!    Verify Qualtrics Account Login You may end up using a survey in this course so its a good idea to go to the WVU Qualtrics login page and simply make sure you can login. If you are unable to do so, please submit a ticket to IT or give them a ring at 304-293-4444 as soon as possible.  Drawing Evaluations Get a blank piece of paper and writing utensil or use a computer program to draw a picture of the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the word “Evaluation”. Think about what that picture means to you and then write a post describing the picture you drew and explaining why you think that was the picture that first came to your mind in relation to “Evaluation”. If you drew a picture, scan your picture and attach it to your post.

Remember to use the Reply in thread option when replying! If you need a reminder on how to do this, please click here.\n  Evaluation Approaches Look through the CDC’s Types of Evaluations document to get yourself familiarized with various approaches to conducting evaluations. It is important to note that summative evaluations are not listed.\n Creating Evaluation Teams Finalize your evaluation teams that must consist of three to four members. Then talk among yourselves to figure out three possible weekly meetings times/days that you can get together to discuss materials about the course and the eventual evaluation. To begin, I will join you on a biweekly basis to discuss items and to answer any questions you may have. If the team appears to be on track as we progress, I will reduce my participation unless needed.\nPlease fill out the necessary columns in the csv file addressing\n   Column Name  Description      First Name  The first names of each team member on separate lines.    Last Name  The last names of each team member on separate lines.    Email Address  Corresponding preferential email address on separate lines.    Meeting Day/Time 1  Your team’s first choice for a day/time to meet.    Meeting Day/Time 2  Your team’s second choice for a day/time to meet.    Meeting Day/Time 3  Your team’s last choice for a day/time to meet.       Download the Form  \nAlso please name your group. Feel free to be serious or have fun with it!\nPick one person to email me with the filled out .csv and the name of your group as the file name.\n Learning About Criteria We’ll be covering three primary concepts in evaluation: criteria, standards and indicators. While all three are extremely important, the trait that can have the greatest impact on the planning of an evaluation is in constructing the proper criteria. With that in mind, please view and listen to the Criterial and Interpretive Evaluation slideshow. You can also download a PDF of the presentation.\n You can move back and forth using ← and → and toggle fullscreen by pressing F. Just press O1 at any point in your slideshow and a display of all slides, called tile view, will appear. Click on a slide to go there or press O to exit tile view.

Based on that program and the context within which it operates, answer the questions listed below. To do this, you will need to conduct at least one interview and/or focus group (face-to-face, telephone, or synchronous chat).\nThe intent of the meeting is be to help you answer the questions and better meet stakeholder information and decision-making needs. Therefore, you should be interviewing a key stakeholder or (focus) group of stakeholders. You have options in how to conduct this\n If done face-to-face or telephone, you should tape (audio or video2) your interview / focus group and transcribe the recording.\n If done electronically utilizing synchronous (e.g., chat room) technology, then often the transcription is done for you. For example, Zoom has this ability via their Cloud Service.\n   Structure This submission is due in two weeks3 and The following components are required for your submission in the order listed below and must be uploaded as a single cohesive document . Barring items 1 and 2, all other criteria must be in standard APA 7th edition formatting.\nA cover page with your name   Every group member’s name in the upper left-hand corner in alphabetical order in accordance to their last name. For those teams that have assigned internal roles, please include those titles in parentheses. The title of this task – Needs Assessment – in the middle of the page.  No running head\n A Table of Contents\n The Body fulfilling the requirements described below\n A references section4\n Appendix describing Analysis Technique as described below.\n Any additional materials you believe will help in the determination of my evaluation of your submission. Classify these by type and separate them into differing Appendices. There is no limit to the number of Appendices.5\n Filename in either of the following formats\n   teamname_needsassessent.docx\n teamname_needsassessent.pdf\n  Body As you construct this, you must use the questions as your subheadings and answers must be up formally. Your answers should be brief and to the point. This assignment usually fills five (5) to 10 pages double spaced not including the appendix. That section includes a brief description of your analysis technique (please see below).\n Who did you interview? What is their role in the program? What are the goals and objectives for the program you will evaluate? Describe what you discovered about the merit, worth, and significance of the program? What specific values were described in the interview? Which ones do you believe are feasible to study and why? Who is the program designed to serve? Include as much demographic detail as possible (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.) for each group impacted by the program (e.g., students, parents, clients, etc.). Give your best estimates if precise demographic information is not available. What are the means through which program goals and objectives are expected to be met? What activities does the program utilize to serve its clientele? What is the history of this program? How long has it been in existence? How has it changed over time? What evaluation work, if any, has occurred in the past? What data currently exists relative to goals, objectives, and activities of this program? Describe the data you believe exists even if you don’t currently have access to that data. Did you learn anything from any non-verbal cues? If so, what were they and did they affect your decision on potential avenues to pursue? Is there anything else not covered in the items above? If you had to perform the interview again, would there be anything you change? Please be honest. While it any sound silly to some, a reflection on the process and approaches taken will most likely help you perform in future interviews. Rather than writing a narrative here, I suggest that you provide a table with one column dedicated to what occurred, the second outlining what you would change, and the third with a very brief description as to why.   Analysis Technique In past renditions of this course, students were required to transcribe the entire interview. While that is still recommended , it is not required. Should you choose to do so, there are many free ways to go about this. Some students have paid a service to do it for them – which is fine as it is common practice in evaluation – while most have used free online and offline services. If a transcription is an avenue you wish to pursue and do not wish to spend any money, services such as Google Cloud and SpeechText.AI use grounded artificial intelligence approaches to transcribe audio. Regardless of your decision regarding the above, please follow the steps below to analyze your recording:\nEach member should independently listen to the recording in its entirety while jotting down notes regrading particular items of interest and themes that may occur. Should you have the benefit of having a video recording, consider adding notes about non-verbal cues and points of inflection. Make sure to note the timestamp or the next step will be extremely difficult!\n After everyone has accomplished the task above, meet as a group and discuss your findings. Come to an agreement as to what may be potential themes and avenues to consider for an evaluation. From this, you have two choices for justification:\n   Quantitative approach. Consider using an agreement scaling like a Kappa Statistic as your justification. Then provide a clear and concise narrative on your process, your agreement threshold and what criteria were used (i.e. please just don’t simply say we agreed on theme X because we felt like it, rather provide actual criteria for agreement). Please submit the final agreement measures delineated by theme in addition to the aggregated agreement score and description. To clarify, you will be required to submit the following in the appendix:  A table of all themes and corresponding agreement rating by theme. Please rearrange the themes by agreement rating going from greatest to least. An aggregated and specific list of criteria used for agreement. If some of these are theme specific, please note that. A short and concise narrative explain the process, criteria, and benchmarks for agreement. Include the final agreement score and what scaling you used.  Qualitative approach. Should you choose not to use an agreement scaling, describe the process in a clear manner and in great detail within your appendix. Read over Shenton (2004) and ensure that you address all four of Guba’s constructs provided on p. 64. Most importantly, provide a narrative on how triangulation and saturation were fully addressed. To clarify, you will be required to submit the following in the appendix:  A table of all themes regardless of agreement. A detailed and explicit narrative regarding how credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability were satisfied or an argument as to why it could not. A through narrative further delineating credibility by addressing multiple provisions provided in Shenton (2004) and how these were accomplished. A short and concise narrative on how triangulation and saturation were fully addressed. Make sure to be very specific in addressing what criteria were used and how each was satisfied.   :::\n    Students in the course must participate in the writing process in a group oriented setting.↩︎\n Better for reviewing purposes.↩︎\n Please check eCampus for the exact due date.↩︎\n If necessary↩︎\n Optional↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9f745fa46e63073f692d47da1df6f680","permalink":"https://edp617.theoreticalphysed.com/assignment/05-needs-assessment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/05-needs-assessment/","section":"assignment","summary":"Needs Assessment  Submission Type Description Criteria Structure     ul { margin-left: 1.5em; }  Needs Assessment Submission eCampus\n Type Teams1\n Description At this point you should begin to contact programs and possibly narrow your list.","tags":null,"title":"Needs Assessment","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Please head over to the Needs Assessment page to get a preview of what is due in a little over two weeks.\n:::\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7337e9261c3514039025dedd39df2948","permalink":"https://edp617.theoreticalphysed.com/assignment/05-assignment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/05-assignment/","section":"assignment","summary":"Please head over to the Needs Assessment page to get a preview of what is due in a little over two weeks.\n:::","tags":null,"title":"Who's Values Are Valuable?","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"    What’s Due?

Similar to a viewpoint on statistics and methodology in general, this view can create situations where practitioners try to pigeonhole an evaluation to fit some predefined framework. Evaluation is not a these models fit all kind of field. However, one of the most utilized frameworks - the CIPP Model - is mentioned in the EVCC and should you perform any evaluation work in the future, it is likely that you will at least hear it being mentioned. With that said, its not a bad idea to have a look.\n Learning About Surveys Some of you will no doubt be utilizing survey instruments within your evaluation. However constructing meaningful surveys can be quite difficult and response rates can be affected by anything from wording to distribution times to aesthetics. While this is certainly not a survey development course, please view and listen to the Survey Design slideshow.

These topics are what you should cover, at minimum, in your proposal. Your answers should be brief, to the point and must address the given topic area explicitly. Remember to maintain a continuous narrative and proper flow. This assignment usually fills seven (7) to 12 double spaced pages.\n General Outline  Introduction. A brief description of the program concentrating on what areas of importance you discovered in the Needs Assessment. This should be brief and is typically no more than one (1) page maximum.\n Justification. You must include evidence from, at minimum, the items we have covered in the course so far as a defense for your approach. In this case, you are providing an evidence-based argument for the way you want to conduct the study. At minimum, the topics covered here should address an intended evaluative framework/orientation/model/approach that will guide your program evaluation and answer how this construct will be well-suited to evaluate the program.\n Methodology. This section will be the largest and most detailed component. This is will be your chance to detail the intended evaluative process and to justify your methodological approach. At minimum, please cover the following where applicable\n Sampling frame. A description of the overall targeted population and sample that you have drawn or will draw. This includes a description of the primary stakeholders, or those you are studying, and secondary stakeholders, or those who are not directly affected by the program.\n Assessment of Values. Address what set of values you will be using in your evaluation. This should be very explicit, and you must explain where these came from?\n Existing Data. If applicable, provide a description of what existing data will you be using within your evaluation, how you plan on accessing that data and what form the raw data will be in.\n Data Collection. Discuss what data you will utilize within your evaluation, how you will collect that data, what instruments and/or materials you will be using or plan to use, and how you will gain permission from those who are participating.\n Analysis. Provide a narrative on the type of raw data you will have. Address how you intend to analyze the quantitative, qualitative, and or mixed data you will have.\n Reporting Cycle. Briefly discuss how the results will be reported to the sponsor, when you intend to do so, and if you are intending to provide an interim report.\n  Statement of Intent6. On a separate page, please provide a one paragraph statement of intent on whether you plan to use or publish your work beyond the framework of this course and your corresponding reasoning.\n   If you do intend to publish, then please select this   Your team submission should include the following components separated into three parts external deliverable. Your final report submitted to the sponsor that is written to be easily accessible and consumable evaluation assessment7. Form a coherent and detailed narrative addressing what you would do differently given the chance to perform your evaluation over again. You can think of this as a reflection of all activities and personnel associated with the evaluation. Specificity, clarity and distinct connections to the course content will be key here. (optional) client authorization. If anybody on your team intends to use this report outside of this course in any capacity (e.g. as an example of work), you must submit a signed release from the sponsor. This serves as a binding document.\n     If you do not intend to publish, then please select this   Your team submission should include the following components separated into three parts external deliverable. Your final report submitted to the sponsor that is written to be easily accessible and consumable original manuscript8 A solid and coherent draft of a publication based off of your evaluation. (optional) client authorization. You must submit a signed release from the sponsor permitting the use of the evaluation for the purposes of an academic publication. This serves as a binding document.\n     Notes:\n Using your evaluation in any capacity outside of the course requires a client authorization. An IRB submission may also also required but should not be included in your submission. You may however submit this request through the WVU+kc system.  Please be sure of your intent! The way in which I consult you will differ based on your statement.

You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\nRStudio.cloud R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free RStudio.cloud service initially, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.\nGo to https://rstudio.cloud/ and create an account. You’ll receive a link to join the shared class workspace separately. If you don’t get this link, let me know and I will invite you.\n RStudio on your computer RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since RStudio.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica.\nHere’s how you install all these things\nInstall R First you need to install R itself (the engine).\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\n Click on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n If you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (as of this writing, it’s R-4.0.0.pkg; as of right now but download the most current version.\n If you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n  Double click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n If you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n   Install RStudio Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\n The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n  Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n Install tidyverse R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n   It’s a goofy name, but CRAN is where most R packages—and R itself—lives.↩︎\n   ","date":1594771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594771200,"objectID":"efb59c0882a965443ffcbafa3cd27ca6","permalink":"https://edp617.theoreticalphysed.com/resource/install/","publishdate":"2020-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resource/install/","section":"resource","summary":"RStudio.cloud RStudio on your computer  Install R Install RStudio Install tidyverse    You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!","tags":null,"title":"Installing R, RStudio, and tidyverse","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   Basic Markdown formatting Math Tables Footnotes Front matter Citations Other references   Markdown is a special kind of markup language that lets you format text with simple syntax.

There are like a billion little options and features available for math equations—you can find helpful examples of the the most common basic commands here.\nYou can use math in two different ways: inline or in a display block. To use math inline, wrap it in single dollar signs, like $y = mx + b$:\n    Type… …to get    Based on the DAG, the regression model for estimating the effect of education on wages is $\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon$, or $\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon$. Based on the DAG, the regression model for estimating the effect of education on wages is \\(\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon\\), or \\(\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon\\).    To put an equation on its own line in a display block, wrap it in double dollar signs, like this:\nType…\nThe quadratic equation was an important part of high school math: $$ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$ But now we just use computers to solve for $x$. …to get…\n The quadratic equation was an important part of high school math:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\nBut now we just use computers to solve for \\(x\\).\n Because dollar signs are used to indicate math equations, you can’t just use dollar signs like normal if you’re writing about actual dollars. For instance, if you write This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40, Markdown will treat everything that comes between the dollar signs as math, like so: “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\nTo get around that, put a backslash (\\) in front of the dollar signs, so that This book costs \\$5.75 and this other costs \\$40 becomes “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\n Tables There are 4 different ways to hand-create tables in Markdown—I say “hand-create” because it’s normally way easier to use R to generate these things with packages like pander (use pandoc.table()) or knitr (use kable()). The two most common are simple tables and pipe tables. You should look at the full documentation here.\nFor simple tables, type…\n Right Left Center Default ------- ------ ---------- ------- 12 12 12 12 123 123 123 123 1 1 1 1 Table: Caption goes here …to get…\n Caption goes here  Right Left Center Default    12 12 12 12  123 123 123 123  1 1 1 1    For pipe tables, type…\n| Right | Left | Default | Center | |------:|:-----|---------|:------:| | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | | 123 | 123 | 123 | 123 | | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Table: Caption goes here …to get…\n Caption goes here  Right Left Default Center    12 12 12 12  123 123 123 123  1 1 1 1     Footnotes There are two different ways to add footnotes (see here for complete documentation): regular and inline.\nRegular notes need (1) an identifier and (2) the actual note. The identifier can be whatever you want. Some people like to use numbers like [^1], but if you ever rearrange paragraphs or add notes before #1, the numbering will be wrong (in your Markdown file, not in the output; everything will be correct in the output). Because of that, I prefer to use some sort of text label:\nType…\nHere is a footnote reference[^1] and here is another [^note-on-dags]. [^1]: This is a note. [^note-on-dags]: DAGs are neat. And here\u0026#39;s more of the document. …to get…\n Here is a footnote reference1 and here is another.2\nAnd here’s more of the document.\n  This is a note.↩︎   DAGs are neat.↩︎     You can also use inline footnotes with ^[Text of the note goes here], which are often easier because you don’t need to worry about identifiers:\nType…\nCausal inference is neat.^[But it can be hard too!] …to get…\n Causal inference is neat.1\n  But it can be hard too!↩︎      Front matter You can include a special section at the top of a Markdown document that contains metadata (or data about your document) like the title, date, author, etc. This section uses a special simple syntax named YAML (or “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”) that follows this basic outline: setting: value for setting. Here’s an example YAML metadata section. Note that it must start and end with three dashes (---).\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; --- You can put the values inside quotes (like the date and name in the example above), or you can leave them outside of quotes (like the title in the example above). I typically use quotes just to be safe—if the value you’re using has a colon (:) in it, it’ll confuse Markdown since it’ll be something like title: My cool title: a subtitle, which has two colons. It’s better to do this:\n--- title: \u0026quot;My cool title: a subtitle\u0026quot; --- If you want to use quotes inside one of the values (e.g. your document is An evaluation of \"scare quotes\"), you can use single quotes instead:\n--- title: \u0026#39;An evaluation of \u0026quot;scare quotes\u0026quot;\u0026#39; ---  Citations One of the most powerful features of Markdown + pandoc is the ability to automatically cite things and generate bibliographies. to use citations, you need to create a BibTeX file (ends in .bib) that contains a database of the things you want to cite. You can do this with bibliography managers designed to work with BibTeX directly (like BibDesk on macOS), or you can use Zotero (macOS and Windows) to export a .bib file. You can download an example .bib file of all the readings from this class here.\nComplete details for using citations can be found here.

You can do everything you can with regular Markdown, but you can incorporate graphs, tables, and other R output directly in your document. You can create HTML, PDF, and Word documents, PowerPoint and HTML presentations, websites, books, and even interactive dashboards with R Markdown. This whole course website is created with R Markdown (and a package named blogdown).\nThe documentation for R Markdown is extremely comprehensive, and their tutorials and cheatsheets are excellent—rely on those.\nHere are the most important things you’ll need to know about R Markdown in this class:\nKey terms  Document: A Markdown file where you type stuff\n Chunk: A piece of R code that is included in your document. It looks like this:\n```{r} # Code goes here ``` There must be an empty line before and after the chunk. The final three backticks must be the only thing on the line—if you add more text, or if you forget to add the backticks, or accidentally delete the backticks, your document will not knit correctly.\n Knit: When you “knit” a document, R runs each of the chunks sequentially and converts the output of each chunk into Markdown. R then runs the knitted document through pandoc to convert it to HTML or PDF or Word (or whatever output you’ve selected).\nYou can knit by clicking on the “Knit” button at the top of the editor window, or by pressing ⌘⇧K on macOS or control + shift + K on Windows.\n   Add chunks There are three ways to insert chunks:\n Press ⌘⌥I on macOS or control + alt + I on Windows\n Click on the “Insert” button at the top of the editor window\n Manually type all the backticks and curly braces (don’t do this)\n   Chunk names You can add names to chunks to make it easier to navigate your document. If you click on the little dropdown menu at the bottom of your editor in RStudio, you can see a table of contents that shows all the headings and chunks. If you name chunks, they’ll appear in the list. If you don’t include a name, the chunk will still show up, but you won’t know what it does.\nTo add a name, include it immediately after the {r in the first line of the chunk. Names cannot contain spaces, but they can contain underscores and dashes. All chunk names in your document must be unique.\n```{r name-of-this-chunk} # Code goes here ```  Chunk options There are a bunch of different options you can set for each chunk. You can see a complete list in the RMarkdown Reference Guide or at knitr’s website.\nOptions go inside the {r} section of the chunk:\n```{r name-of-this-chunk, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE} # Code goes here ``` The most common chunk options are these:\n fig.width=5 and fig.height=3 (or whatever number you want): Set the dimensions for figures echo=FALSE: The code is not shown in the final document, but the results are message=FALSE: Any messages that R generates (like all the notes that appear after you load a package) are omitted warning=FALSE: Any warnings that R generates are omitted include=FALSE: The chunk still runs, but the code and results are not included in the final document  You can also set chunk options by clicking on the little gear icon in the top right corner of any chunk:\n Inline chunks You can also include R output directly in your text, which is really helpful if you want to report numbers from your analysis. To do this, use `r r_code_here`.\nIt’s generally easiest to calculate numbers in a regular chunk beforehand and then use an inline chunk to display the value in your text. For instance, this document…\n```{r find-avg-mpg, echo=FALSE} avg_mpg \u0026lt;- mean(mtcars$mpg) ``` The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was `r round(avg_mpg, 1)` miles per gallon. … would knit into this:\n The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was 20.1 miles per gallon.\n  Output formats You can specify what kind of document you create when you knit in the YAML front matter.\ntitle: \u0026quot;My document\u0026quot; output: html_document: default pdf_document: default word_document: default You can also click on the down arrow on the “Knit” button to choose the output and generate the appropriate YAML. If you click on the gear icon next to the “Knit” button and choose “Output options”, you change settings for each specific output type, like default figure dimensions or whether or not a table of contents is included.\nThe first output type listed under output: will be what is generated when you click on the “Knit” button or press the keyboard shortcut (⌘⇧K on macOS; control + shift + K on Windows). If you choose a different output with the “Knit” button menu, that output will be moved to the top of the output section.\nThe indentation of the YAML section matters, especially when you have settings nested under each output type. Here’s what a typical output section might look like:\n--- title: \u0026quot;My document\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;My name\u0026quot; date: \u0026quot;August 19, 2020\u0026quot; output: html_document: toc: yes fig_caption: yes fig_height: 8 fig_width: 10 pdf_document: latex_engine: xelatex # More modern PDF typesetting engine toc: yes word_document: toc: yes fig_caption: yes fig_height: 4 fig_width: 5 ---  ","date":1594771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594771200,"objectID":"00c0b36df90b91640842af65d1311657","permalink":"https://edp617.theoreticalphysed.com/resource/rmarkdown/","publishdate":"2020-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resource/rmarkdown/","section":"resource","summary":"Key terms Add chunks Chunk names Chunk options Inline chunks Output formats   R Markdown is regular Markdown with R code and output sprinkled in.

All of these things will do exactly the same thing:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) filter ( mpg,cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot; ) But you’ll notice that only a few of those iterations (the first three) are easily readable.\nTo help improve readability and make it easier to share code with others, there’s an unofficial style guide for writing R code. It’s fairly short and just has lots of examples of good and bad ways of writing code (naming variables, dealing with long lines, using proper indentation levels, etc.)—you should glance through it some time.\nRStudio has a built-in way of cleaning up your code. Select some code, press ctrl + i (on Windows) or ⌘ + i (on macOS), and R will reformat the code for you. It’s not always perfect, but it’s really helpful for getting indentation right without having to manually hit space a billion times.\n Main style things to pay attention to for this class  Important note: I won’t ever grade you on any of this! If you submit something like filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\"compact\"), I might recommend adding spaces, but it won’t affect your grade or points or anything.\n Spacing  See the “Spacing” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Put spaces after commas (like in regular English):\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg , cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg ,cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg,cty \u0026gt; 10) Put spaces around operators like +, -, \u0026gt;, =, etc.:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt;10) filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt;10) Don’t put spaces around parentheses that are parts of functions:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter (mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter ( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10 )  Long lines  See the “Long lines” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n It’s generally good practice to not have really long lines of code. A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (ew), in RStudio go to “Tools” \u0026gt; “Global Options” \u0026gt; “Code” \u0026gt; “Display” and check the box for “Show margin”. You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this—that’s fine. It’s just good practice to avoid going too far past it.\nYou can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Bad filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;)) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;))  Pipes (%\u0026gt;%) and ggplot layers (+) Put each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the + at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() Put each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the %\u0026gt;% at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  Comments  See the “Comments” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Comments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: #\n# Good #Bad #Bad If the comment is really short (and won’t cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code, separated by at least two spaces (it works with one space, but using a couple can enhance readability):\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group You can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group If the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines. RStudio can do this for you if you go to “Code” \u0026gt; “Reflow comment”\n# Good # Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. # Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house.

When you unzip a zipped file, your operating system extracts all the files that are contained inside into a new folder on your computer.\nUnzipping files on macOS is trivial, but unzipping files on Windows can mess you up if you don’t pay careful attention. Here’s a helpful guide to unzipping files on both macOS and Windows.\nUnzipping files on macOS Double click on the downloaded .zip file. macOS will automatically create a new folder with the same name as the .zip file, and all the file’s contents will be inside. Double click on the RStudio Project file (.Rproj) to get started.\n Unzipping files on Windows tl;dr: Right click on the .zip file, select “Extract All…”, and work with the resulting unzipped folder.\nUnlike macOS, Windows does not automatically unzip things for you. If you double click on the .zip file, Windows will show you what’s inside, but it will do so without actually extracting anything. This can be is incredibly confusing! Here’s what it looks like—the only clues that this folder is really a .zip file are that there’s a “Compressed Folder Tools” tab at the top, and there’s a “Ratio” column that shows how much each file is compressed.\nIt is very tempting to try to open files from this view. However, if you do, things will break and you won’t be able to correctly work with any of the files in the zipped folder. If you open the R Project file, for instance, RStudio will point to a bizarre working directory buried deep in some temporary folder:\nYou most likely won’t be able to open any data files or save anything, which will be frustrating.\nInstead, you need to right click on the .zip file and select “Extract All…”:\nThen choose where you want to unzip all the files and click on “Extract”\nYou should then finally have a real folder with all the contents of the zipped file.

Online  Slack   Contacting me Slack is the best way to get in contact with me. Response times are typically much quicker than the standard 24-48 hours given to emails. Please remember that life is still chaotic at this time!\n  Course objectives Students will be expected to develop the following knowledge, skills, and abilities, including but not limited to:\nAcquiring knowledge of basic models and principles of program evaluation Developing an understanding of program evaluation practice by designing and conducting an evaluation of a program relevant to their degree and individual interests. Learning how to write an evaluation report to meet stakeholder information and decision-making needs Explaining the different types and uses of variables in a research study. Gaining an understanding of ethical, social, political, and cultural issues confronted by program evaluators.   FAQ Is the course content difficult? You’ve probably heard an answer like this before: At times some of the material can be dense. Well that isn’t much of a response. Difficulty is not the issue here since as humans with differing educational background, we will have strengths in some areas more than others. Instead the question is can you identify areas that need strengthened and communicate them? If you can, then you have a good shot at succeeding in this class.\n Is there a lot of theory? Evaluation is a practice based field so much of what you will come across will align with that notion. With that said, while I have tried to get rid of any and all theory, some basic concepts need an underlying construct or idea.\n What if I find a mistake? Tell me! I strive to be error free but like everyone else, make silly mistakes. This includes grammar and spelling errors as well!\n  Course materials There are two texts, though you will receive some supplementary materials in the course as well.\nTexts Required We’ll rely on the texts below. Both are available through the WVU library WVU library:\n Davidson, E. J. (2007). Evaluation methodology basics: The nuts and bolts of sound evaluation (1st ed.). SAGE.  Digital edition (free!) Hardcover edition (not free) - ISBN: 9780761729307  American Psychological Association. (2020). Publication manual of the American Psychological Association (7th ed.). (ISBN: 978-1433832161)  Spiral bound edition (not free though the WVU library have copies of the official paperback variant - ISBN: 978143383217    Optional  Mertens, D. M. (2018). Mixed methods design in evaluation. SAGE.  There will occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the content page for that session.\n  Software Quatrics You will need access to your WVU Qualtrics account. Please go to the site and check if you can login. If you are enrolled as a WVU student, then you should have access. However if you do not, submit a ticket to IT or give them a ring at 304-293-4444.\n R and RStudio (Optional) Again, this is totally optional but may interest some of you. If this is the case, please let me know and I will add you to the training modules.\nWhile required for most of the methods courses I teach, you have the option in this course to learn about the open source (and free!)statistical platform R via the software RStudio. You can think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard — R handles all the calculations produces the actual statistics and graphical output, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code. Please note that\nyou do not need to have any programming experience to use R\n R is free, but it can sometimes be a task to install and configure. To make life easier, you can opt to use the free RStudio.cloud service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This is recommended for those of you who do not want to install programs right now or just wabt to test it out.\nThe service is convenient, but please keep in mind that it can be slow and is not designed to handle large data sets or more complicated analysis and graphics. You also cannot customize much with RStudio.cloud. As you learn more, you’ll want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud.\nYou can find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.\n  Note: Online help Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and its always the tiny errors in your coding can result in tons of headache. People working in any syntax based software package at any level experience this!\nBut there are multiple resources online to help.\n First you will have access to Data Camp which allows you to relieve professional training that otherwise costs a lot of money. Is it perfect and flashy? Nope but it is interactive and if you pay attention, then R’s initial steep learning curve won’t feel much like an uphill battle.\n Second two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q\u0026amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)). I freely admit that StackOverflow has saved me multiple hours of frustration. Just note if you have a syntax or process issue, both sites require you to produce a minimally reproducible example.\n Third using Twitter you can post R-related questions and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.\n Fourth searching for help with R on Google (or another indexed search site) can sometimes be tricky because the program name is,for a lack of a better explanation, a single letter.\n Fifth we have a class chatroom at Slack where you can poise a question. I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond quickly. (This is a rare instances where I keep notifications on so please utilize it!) Ask questions about the readings, exercises, and mini projects. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too.\n Sixth and lastly you can send items by Slack or email me with questions about content, R or whatever (after giving a graduate student effort of course). Please include the subject header EDP 617 “the title of your email” where the title of your email is given without the quotes. If you do email me, please include the following:\n A brief description of the problem and what you have done thus far including the line number of the issue (if applicable). A copy of your data set (if applicable). A copy of your script or Rmarkdown document with comments throughout so I know what you’ve tried historically leading up to the issue.   I have a mail filter that will automatically bring your email to a top priority status.1\nYou should absolutely expect to struggle at times, but there is no better and more satisfying feeling than figuring things out for yourself! In the long run, you’re more likely to remember things you’ve figured out rather than those you’ve been shown or told.\n  Assignments and Grades You can find up to date descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page.\n   Percent  Assignment      15  Weekly Tasks    15  Synchronous Meetings    5  Evaluation Prospectus    20  Needs Assessment    15  Evaluation Proposal    25  Final Report    5  Presentation of Results      \n   Grade  Range      A  90–100%    B  80%-89%    C  70–79%    D  60–69%    F  \u0026lt; 60%      \nAll materials are due on a weekly basis by Sunday at 11:59 PM unless otherwise noted. New material will be posted on the course website by Tuesday afternoon by 12:00 PM.\nYour hours Please watch this video:\n Your hours (formerly known as office hours) are set times dedicated to you the student!2). This means that I will be in my office at home waiting for you to come by talk to me remotely with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.\nBecause of the pandemic, we cannot meet in person. I can meet you online via Zoom. You can request a meeting through the calendar, e-mail or Slack.\n Class conduct and expectations Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up with or stole from other professors:\n Late work: Barring the three main course tasks, past due deliverables will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via eCampus. There are no exceptions to this policy. Please note that I will not accept coursework by email or any other means.\n Participation: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate in class. Engagement is mostly defined by you—if that means commenting and answering questions, neat; if it means sitting quietly and being focused, also neat; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off, not so neat.\n Justifications: On any submission, you must justiofy any assertion. I don’t know what you know so its your job to provide all of the necessary evidence to convince me that you do know what you say you know. While you’ve probably heard this multiple times over your life, think of it this way: if someone tells you that not only is the Earth flat, the core is actually made out of tiramisu and moscato, the first question you should be asking is what’s your evidence? possibly followed by is the core delicious?.\n Rubrics: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level, I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:\nWhen writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), a rubric isn’t often provided. If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up). Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor. Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!   Technology use: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. We’re all adults3.\n My philosophy:\nJust assume that all submissions are formal and must be submitted with the appropriate use of language, grammar, syntax, etc. and follow standard APA 7th edition formatting guidelines where applicable. People who are easily offended by content, believe their work to be flawless or are generally unable to handle criticism should consider looking at another course. If you want rainbows and ponies, consider another class. If you care about data, fieldwork and learning a highly marketable practice, you’ve come to the right place. There is a great deal of content in this course and you will likely struggle with some at times. Given that, there is also something to be said about the satisfaction a person gets when figuring something out, but nowhere is it written that has to be on your own. You may find that a nudge here or there elicits the same feeling so please reach out for help.    Learning and knowledge during a pandemic When course objectives are written explicitly and clearly, they provide the information you need to figure out what a student should be able to do by the end of a given term. In fact, professors often test your proficiency in an area through multiple assessments such as exams, papers, presentations, etc where you are essentially asked to show us what you have learned. However learning is not the same as knowledge .\nTo save you from a long philosophical narrative on epistemology, in a nutshell we humans aren’t that good at evaluating a person’s knowledge mainly because its not a well-defined concept. With that said, we believe one indicator of knowledge is in a person’s ability to successfully explain a high level concept in such a way that the lay person can understand it. Every so often, consider asking yourself this:\nCan I describe whatever using language so that anyone could understand it?\n On top of what’s noted above and I’m not sure how to articulate this any better - life sucks right now! It is likely by now you know people who have been hospitalized or passed away, lost their jobs, and/or tested positive for COVID-19. Additionally stresses in life are up. Given this, here is my promise to you:\nIf you keep an open line, show initiative, and let me know ahead of time if something is going not according to plan4, I will do everything I can to help you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class!\n   Course policies Its pretty simple: Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat. Stay in touch. Be a good human.\n We will also follow WVU’s Code of Conduct.\nThis syllabus reflects a plan for the term but things change and plans change. so deviations may become necessary as we move along during the term. Note that I reserve the right to alter or amend this syllabus and will send notifications if course tasks are affected.\n COVID-19 Statement WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.\nIn a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe the social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines set by the University at all times. While in class, students will sit in assigned seats when applicable and wear the required PPE. Should a student forget to bring the required PPE, PPE will be available in the building for students to acquire. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.\nIf a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes.\nPsychological and Psychiatric Services Life at WVU can be complicated and challenging, especially during a pandemic! You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. Psychological and Psychiatric Services provides free, confidential support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The office is staffed by professional counselors and psychiatrists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students. Please do not hesitate to contact them for assistance—getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n CARE Team If you or anyone you know may be at-risk such as those listed here, please make a CARE referral. You may do so directly at the main WVU CARE TEAM site.\n Lauren’s Promise I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\n Lauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or the Campus Police at 304-293-3136.\nIf you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call/text a private Title IX On-Call Line 304-906-9930.\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at West Virginia University. WVU has instituted procedures to respond to violations of these laws and standards, programs aimed at the prevention of such conduct, and intervention on behalf of the victims.\n Academic Integrity The integrity of the classes offered by any academic institution solidifies the foundation of its mission and cannot be sacrificed to expediency, ignorance, or blatant fraud. Therefore, I will enforce rigorous standards of academic integrity in all aspects and assignments of this course. For the detailed policy of West Virginia University regarding the definitions of acts considered to fall under academic dishonesty and possible ensuing sanctions, please see the West Virginia University Academic Catalog at http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. Should you have any questions about possibly improper research citations or references, or any other activity that may be interpreted as an attempt at academic dishonesty, please see me before the assignment is due to discuss the matter.\n Inclusivity Statement The West Virginia University community is committed to creating and fostering a positive learning and working environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and inclusion.\nIf you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of accommodation in order to participate in this class, please advise me and make appropriate arrangements with the Office of Accessibility Services (304-293-6700).\nFor more information on West Virginia University’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, please see http://diversity.wvu.edu.\n Incomplete Grades Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term. If the instructor agrees, the instructor and the student must negotiate the conditions under which the grade of I will be changed to a letter grade and sign a contract. The date to submit the incomplete work should not be set beyond the last day of class of the following semester. If the student does not complete the terms of contract, then the instructor should submit a grade of F. All incomplete contracts must be filed with the department and Dean’s Office. See the policy at [Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term.

See the policy at http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/enrollmentandregistration/#gradestext.\n Sale of Course Materials All course materials, including lectures, class notes, quizzes, exams, handouts, presentations, and other materials provided to students for this course are protected under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Please review the sharing and editing restrictions prior to distributing or amending any material on this site. As such, the unauthorized purchase or sale of these materials may result in disciplinary sanctions under the Campus Student Code. Basically you can share what you like but don’t try to make a buck.\n Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI) Effective teaching is a primary mission of West Virginia University. Student evaluation of instruction provides the university and the instructor with feedback about your experiences in the course for review and course improvement. Your participation in the evaluation of course instruction is both strongly encouraged and highly valued. Results are strictly confidential, anonymous, and not available to the instructor until after final grades are released by Admissions and Records. Information about how you can complete this evaluation will be provided later.\n University Attendance Policy At West Virginia University, class attendance contributes significantly to academic success. Students who attend classes regularly tend to earn higher grades and have higher passing rates in courses. Excessive absences may jeopardize students’ grades or even their ability to continue in their courses. There is a strong correlation between regular class attendance and academic success.\n Course Netiquette The basic premise is that the etiquette expected of students in the online environment is the same as that expected in a classroom. Common courtesy is the guiding rule of Internet communications. Be prepared to communicate effectively when taking an online course. Following these simple netiquette rules in your online class or education environment will ensure your success:\n Include a professional salutation. In this case, “Hello Dr. Roy” or “Dear Dr. Roy” is appropriate. Include a proper ending such as “Thank you” or “With regards.” Then type in your full name. Never type in ALL CAPS, because it reads as if you ARE SHOUTING AT PEOPLE. Act as professionally, via your writing, as you would in a face to face classroom. Refrain from inappropriate language and derogatory or personal attacks. Do not dominate any discussion. Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion. Disagree with ideas but avoid challenges that may be interpreted as a personal attack. Check that you are replying to the specific person you intend, and not to the entire class. Never give your password to another person. Respect the virtual classroom. Never forward in-class communications or posts by others outside of this virtual space. Never spam your classmates. If you quote someone’s previous post, only quote enough to make your point.  Be aware of the University’s Academic Integrity and Dishonesty Policy http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. You can review the rules, regulations, and procedures concerning student conduct and discipline for the main campus of West Virginia University, at http://campuslife.wvu.edu/r/download/1802350.\n Response Time I generally respond to Slack queries in the same day while responses to emails and discussion posts are within 48 hours, except during holidays. Often, I will reply much more quickly but you should not count on a immediate. Please plan accordingly so that you don’t miss deadlines! I generally return assignments within one to two weeks after a final submission date.\n Technical Requirements Students need to have access to a computer for word processing, e-mail and access to eCampus. Access to the Internet is necessary for completion of this course. Run the Browser Check. This tool will check that you are using a supported Internet browser and have a valid Java version installed. The required technical skills to participate in this course are:\nNavigate the web Use email with attachments Create and submit files in commonly used word processing program formats Copy and paste Download and install software Consult software tutorials and other online sources as a method of learning software features Use syntax when necessary   Technical Support Technical support regarding your use of eCampus is available by contacting 304-293-4444 (telephone), 1-877-327-9260 (toll free number), itshelp@mail.wvu.edu (email), and/or http://it.wvu.edu (website).\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n   In this new normal, I receive an overwhelming number of emails per day and may miss yours if the header is not formatted properly.↩︎\n There is some misunderstanding about what office hours actually are!
