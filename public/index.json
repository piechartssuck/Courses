This section contains descriptions of course tasks. Materials will be posted on a weekly basis. Please note that these pages populate information about course related tasks on the left hand side when they are assigned. Due dates are given with the description of each assignment.\nKeeping Up There are a lot of moving parts to this class. Students who gain the most out of the course generally follow these general notions:\nEngaging with the readings and materials; Putting in a good faith effort but also asking for help when needed; Keeping a respectful, open, and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.   Evaluation Workgroups You will need to form 2 - 4 member support and project groups. There will be a discussion board where you can discuss available times in your schedules for group chats and there will be a group signup tool in Slack1. Once you have completed sign up, Slack will automatically privatize your group.\n General Course Makeup Weekly Postings I will create discussion boards for a variety of purposes including discussing general course questions / logistics, getting to know each other, getting organized into groups, discussing each assignment, etc. You will need to participate actively on each board and your postings should be meaningful and incorporate depth. Responses without any additional information and/or justifications will be considered to be incomplete and will reflect on your final earned point value. The Slack site will include an assignments section organized by week. Within each week, I will post a description of everything you should complete for that week, including discussion board postings, chat room prompts and scaffolding, readings, and assignments as applicable. In addition to working together in the chat rooms, these groups will also do presentations and an evaluation project together. All members must contribute to all of these activities equitably; all members will receive the same grade on all group assignments. If any challenges or contention arise among group members, please let me know immediately so I can address the issue appropriately.\nThese postings will be graded using a check system:\n ✔+: (11.5 points (115%) in the gradebook) Postings address a topic area completely and arguments are exceptional with plenty of justifications. These are not earned often. ✔: (10 points (100%) in the gradebook) Postings mostly address a topic area completely and/or arguments are on point. This is the expected level of performance. ✔−: (5 points (50%) in the gradebook) Postings generally fail to address a topic area completely and/or arguments are on off-point This is the expected level of performance. This indicates that you need to improve next time. Hopefully people will not earn this often.  Otherwise 0 points (0%) in the gradebook.\n Synchronous Meetings There are two types of meetings in this class: ongoing and check-in. Please see the details below for an explanation of each.\nOngoing You will need to meet weekly in the chat room to discuss your understanding, questions, and challenges with the readings, upcoming assignments, etc. I will provide prompts and scaffolding for your discussions. A one page summary consisting of who attended the meeting, content and general synopsis must submitted to eCampus unless otherwise noted.\n Check-in We will need to meet at least six (6) times over the course of term. the primary purpose of this is not just to get to know you, but also to answer any questions you may have and to get an idea of what areas need to be addressed. My job is to serve as a mentor during your evaluation but that requires you to ask questions and be up to date on the course material. I will be using terminology that has been covered and without a frame of reference, the conversation may be difficult.\n  Evaluation Deliverables There are four primary deliverables in the course. Included below are basic descriptions of each but a full set of criteria for each task will be posted as we progress through the term.\nEvaluation Prospectus A general list and brief descriptions of possible programs to evaluate.\n Needs Assessment After identifying a program, your group will be tasked to conduct at least one interview and/or focus group using an approved medium of the primary stakeholder(s) and/or sponsor(s).\n Evaluation Proposal A full proposal of the anticipated evaluation framework including a discussion of the program, its needs, and intended approach/methods.\n Final Report A stakeholder or sponsor oriented report of the full evaluation process written to be accessible and appropriate for the intended audience.\nDepending on the program you evaluate and on how you end up conceptualizing your evaluation study, these assignments may be modified in order to make them more meaningful and applicable to your needs and interests. Further details may be found the individual task documents. Never hesitate to discuss any issues you have relative to the assignments with me. More about these task will be posted in the following weeks.\n  Presentation of Results This task will involve your group presenting on your evaluation. This will be your way of teaching the class about the program your group chose to evaluate and what you learned from conducting your evaluation project.\n Need Help?

Referring to or copying the content within the report beyond the scope of the evaluation within this course.    Note About Usage  Using your evaluation in any capacity outside of the course requires a client authorization. An IRB submission may also also required but should not be included in your submission. You may however submit this request through the WVU+kc system.  Please be sure of your intent! The way in which I consult you will differ based on your statement. This is extremely important primarily due to writing styles, in that the narrative in an academic report often differs significantly from the body of an academic paper.\n  Looking Ahead For the final report, note that you will have to include one the following in the course submission variant depending on your intent:\n   If you did not intend to use the report beyond the course, then please look at this   Your team submission should include the following components separated into three parts external deliverable.

A broad list of sections and descriptions are provided below. However, *always use the formatting and structure defined by your journal of choice\n Title. The title should be specific and indicate the problem the research project addresses using term that will be helpful in searches should your paper be published.\n Keywords. Publishers will more often than not ask you to provide up to five keywords that are generally describe elements of your manuscript.\n Letter to the Editor. Most journals require a letter to the editor where you must make an argument in narrative form explain why you believe the submission fits the journal. You should absolutely review the description of the journal where they often describe what types of submissions will be considered.\n Abstract. The abstract is used by readers to quickly review the overall content of the paper. Journals typically place strict word limits on abstracts, such as 200 words, making them a challenge to write. The abstract should provide a complete synopsis of the research paper and should introduce the topic and the specific research question, provide a statement regarding methodology and should provide a general statement about the results and the findings. Because it is really a summary of the entire research paper, it is often written last.\n Introduction. The introduction begins by introducing the broad overall topic and providing basic background information. It then narrows down to the specific research question relating to this topic. It provides the purpose and focus for the rest of the paper and sets up the justification for the research.\n Literature Review. The purpose of the literature review is to describe past important research and it relate it specifically to the research problem. It should be a synthesis of the previous literature and the new idea being researched. The review should examine the major theories related to the topic to date and their contributors. It should include all relevant findings from credible sources, such as academic books and peer-reviewed journal articles.\n Methods. The methods section will describe the research design and methodology used to complete to the study. The general rule of thumb is that readers should be provided with enough detail to replicate the study.\n Analysis. The analysis section will describe your approach to analyzing your data set(s). The general rule of thumb is that readers should be provided with enough detail to replicate the study.\n Results. In this section, the results of the analysis are presented. How the results are presented will depend upon whether the research study was quantitative or qualitative in nature. This section should focus only on results that are directly related to the research or the problem. Graphs and tables should only be used when there is too much data to efficiently include it within the text. You should absolutely present the results, but not discuss their significance.\n Discussion or Conclusion. This section should be a discussion of the results and the implications on the field, as well as other fields. The hypothesis should be answered and validated by the interpretation of the results. This section should also discuss how the results relate to previous research mentioned in the literature review, any cautions about the findings, and potential for future research.\n References or Bibliography. The research paper is not complete without the list of references. This section should be an alphabetized list of all the academic sources of information utilized in the paper. The format of the references will match the format and style used in the paper. Common formats include APA, MLA, Harvard and so forth.\n    :::\n    Students in the course must participate in the writing process in a group oriented setting.↩︎\n Please check eCampus for the exact due date.↩︎\n It is highly unlikely that a score will be changed unless there is an egregious error on my end so please check your entire document over prior to submission.↩︎\n If necessary↩︎\n Optional↩︎\n Includes a significant amount of detail regarding activities, criteria satisfied, areas of missingness, timeline, and other possible legal concerns should an audit occurs.↩︎\n An authorship agreement with me is required for this option.↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"32b9470b21abf5094c9b7c50ec756751","permalink":"https://edp617.theoreticalphysed.com/deliverables/04-evaluation-report/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/deliverables/04-evaluation-report/","section":"deliverables","summary":"Evaluation Report  Submission Type Description Sections     ul { margin-left: 1.5em; }  Evaluation Report Submission eCampus\n Type Teams1\n Description This submission is divided into two sections","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation Report","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   Needs Assessment  Submission Type Description Criteria Structure     ul { margin-left: 1.5em; }  Needs Assessment Submission eCampus\n Type Teams1\n Description At this point you should begin to contact programs and possibly narrow your list.\n Criteria As soon as you and your group have identified a program to evaluate, you can begin working on this assignment. Based on that program and the context within which it operates, answer the questions listed below. To do this, you will need to conduct at least one interview and/or focus group (face-to-face, telephone, or synchronous chat).\nThe intent of the meeting is be to help you answer the questions and better meet stakeholder information and decision-making needs. Therefore, you should be interviewing a key stakeholder or (focus) group of stakeholders. You have options in how to conduct this\n If done face-to-face or telephone, you should tape (audio or video2) your interview / focus group and transcribe the recording.\n If done electronically utilizing synchronous (e.g., chat room) technology, then often the transcription is done for you. For example, Zoom has this ability via their Cloud Service.\n   Structure This submission is due in two weeks3 and the following components are required for your submission in the order listed below and must be uploaded as a single cohesive document . Barring items 1 and 2, all other criteria must be in standard APA 7th edition formatting.\nA cover page with your name   Every group member’s name in the upper left-hand corner in alphabetical order in accordance to their last name. For those teams that have assigned internal roles, please include those titles in parentheses. The title of this task – Needs Assessment – in the middle of the page.  No running head\n A Table of Contents\n The Body fulfilling the requirements described below\n A references section4\n Appendix describing Analysis Technique as described below.\n Any additional materials you believe will help in the determination of my evaluation of your submission. Classify these by type and separate them into differing Appendices. There is no limit to the number of Appendices.5\n Filename in either of the following formats\n   teamname_needsassessent.docx\n teamname_needsassessent.pdf\n  Body As you construct this, you must use the questions as your subheadings and answers must be up formally. Your answers should be brief and to the point. This assignment usually fills five (5) to 10 pages double spaced not including the appendix. That section includes a brief description of your analysis technique (please see below).\n Who did you interview? What is their role in the program? What are the goals and objectives for the program you will evaluate? Describe what you discovered about the merit, worth, and significance of the program? What specific values were described in the interview? Which ones do you believe are feasible to study and why? Who is the program designed to serve? Include as much demographic detail as possible (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.) for each group impacted by the program (e.g., students, parents, clients, etc.). Give your best estimates if precise demographic information is not available. What are the means through which program goals and objectives are expected to be met? What activities does the program utilize to serve its clientele? What is the history of this program? How long has it been in existence? How has it changed over time? What evaluation work, if any, has occurred in the past? What data currently exists relative to goals, objectives, and activities of this program? Describe the data you believe exists even if you don’t currently have access to that data. Did you learn anything from any non-verbal cues? If so, what were they and did they affect your decision on potential avenues to pursue? Is there anything else not covered in the items above? If you had to perform the interview again, would there be anything you change? Please be honest. While it any sound silly to some, a reflection on the process and approaches taken will most likely help you perform in future interviews. Rather than writing a narrative here, I suggest that you provide a table with one column dedicated to what occurred, the second outlining what you would change, and the third with a very brief description as to why.   Analysis Technique In past renditions of this course, students were required to transcribe the entire interview. While that is still recommended , it is not required. Should you choose to do so, there are many free ways to go about this. Some students have paid a service to do it for them – which is fine as it is common practice in evaluation – while most have used free online and offline services. If a transcription is an avenue you wish to pursue and do not wish to spend any money, services such as Google Cloud and SpeechText.AI use grounded artificial intelligence approaches to transcribe audio. Regardless of your decision regarding the above, please follow the steps below to analyze your recording:\nEach member should independently listen to the recording in its entirety while jotting down notes regrading particular items of interest and themes that may occur. Should you have the benefit of having a video recording, consider adding notes about non-verbal cues and points of inflection. Make sure to note the timestamp or the next step will be extremely difficult!\n After everyone has accomplished the task above, meet as a group and discuss your findings. Come to an agreement as to what may be potential themes and avenues to consider for an evaluation. From this, you have two choices for justification:\n   Quantitative approach. Consider using an agreement scaling like a Kappa Statistic as your justification. Then provide a clear and concise narrative on your process, your agreement threshold and what criteria were used (i.e. please just don’t simply say we agreed on theme X because we felt like it, rather provide actual criteria for agreement). Please submit the final agreement measures delineated by theme in addition to the aggregated agreement score and description. To clarify, you will be required to submit the following in the appendix:  A table of all themes and corresponding agreement rating by theme. Please rearrange the themes by agreement rating going from greatest to least. An aggregated and specific list of criteria used for agreement. If some of these are theme specific, please note that. A short and concise narrative explain the process, criteria, and benchmarks for agreement. Include the final agreement score and what scaling you used.  Qualitative approach. Should you choose not to use an agreement scaling, describe the process in a clear manner and in great detail within your appendix. Read over Shenton (2004) and ensure that you address all four of Guba’s constructs provided on p. 64. Most importantly, provide a narrative on how triangulation and saturation were fully addressed. To clarify, you will be required to submit the following in the appendix:  A table of all themes regardless of agreement. A detailed and explicit narrative regarding how credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability were satisfied or an argument as to why it could not. A through narrative further delineating credibility by addressing multiple provisions provided in Shenton (2004) and how these were accomplished. A short and concise narrative on how triangulation and saturation were fully addressed. Make sure to be very specific in addressing what criteria were used and how each was satisfied.   :::\n    Students in the course must participate in the writing process in a group oriented setting.↩︎\n Better for reviewing purposes.↩︎\n Please check eCampus for the exact due date.↩︎\n If necessary↩︎\n Optional↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"bee987ee0fcee8df14508efda92e2e9e","permalink":"https://edp617.theoreticalphysed.com/deliverables/02-needs-assessment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/deliverables/02-needs-assessment/","section":"deliverables","summary":"Needs Assessment  Submission Type Description Criteria Structure     ul { margin-left: 1.5em; }  Needs Assessment Submission eCampus\n Type Teams1\n Description At this point you should begin to contact programs and possibly narrow your list.","tags":null,"title":"Needs Assessment","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"    What’s Due?

However if in the future you continue to evaluate typical social programs where participant involvement is needed, without getting technical with some statistics1, there is a good chance that one out of the next five or six will be. So the question isn’t if you’ll have one that is participatory, its just a matter of when. Given that, how you balance stakeholder involvement in the planning and execution of a study can really have an effect on its efficacy. Take a bit to think about the following three items and when you’re ready, please address all three in a single narrative and posit it to #reasoning-participatory-evaluations.\nTake a look at the pretty badly rendered plot below. First assess if there is a greater or lesser need for participatory evaluations. Then decide on the level of harm you believe that need would incur. Now choose a letter or group of letters. Interpret and justify your selection.\n Does stakeholder involvement in an evaluation begin to affect the integrity of an evaluation? Defend your response.\n Where do you personally draw the line at stakeholder involvement?\n     Called a Bayesian Beta Regression which really rolls off the tongue…↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"86a399491d0977aee8295e2950c3a1b2","permalink":"https://edp617.theoreticalphysed.com/lesson/10-lesson/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lesson/10-lesson/","section":"lesson","summary":"Meeting Participatory Evaluations  A Refresher Posts     .hvr-sweep-to-left { display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle; -webkit-transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0); transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0); box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); position: relative; -webkit-transition-property: color; transition-property: color; -webkit-transition-duration: 0.","tags":null,"title":"Onboarding","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"    What’s Due?

Note that you do not have to use your WVU account, but its not a bad idea. Head to to the channel #introduce-yourself and well introduce yourself by tell everyone about yourself, what you hope to achieve out of this course, and something about you that really defines who you are. For example, here is something about me: I teach data visualization BUT I am also about 40% colorblind! How do I know what color to use? Take EDP 693E: Data Visualization this term to find out! 1 (optional) Provide a picture if you are willing. I am a very visual person as are many other people so pictures help a great deal. However, you are not mandated to do so!    Verify Qualtrics Account Login You may end up using a survey in this course so its a good idea to go to the WVU Qualtrics login page and simply make sure you can login. If you are unable to do so, please submit a ticket to IT or give them a ring at 304-293-4444 as soon as possible.  Drawing Evaluations Get a blank piece of paper and writing utensil or use a computer program to draw a picture of the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the word “Evaluation”. Think about what that picture means to you and then write a post describing the picture you drew and explaining why you think that was the picture that first came to your mind in relation to “Evaluation”. If you drew a picture, scan your picture and attach it to your post.

If you need a reminder on how to do this, please click here.\n  Evaluation Approaches Look through the CDC’s Types of Evaluations document to get yourself familiarized with various approaches to conducting evaluations. It is important to note that summative evaluations are not listed.\n Creating Evaluation Teams Finalize your evaluation teams that must consist of three to four members. Then talk among yourselves to figure out three possible weekly meetings times/days that you can get together to discuss materials about the course and the eventual evaluation. To begin, I will join you on a biweekly basis to discuss items and to answer any questions you may have. If the team appears to be on track as we progress, I will reduce my participation unless needed.\nPlease fill out the necessary columns in the csv file addressing\n   Column Name  Description      First Name  The first names of each team member on separate lines.    Last Name  The last names of each team member on separate lines.    Email Address  Corresponding preferential email address on separate lines.    Meeting Day/Time 1  Your team’s first choice for a day/time to meet.    Meeting Day/Time 2  Your team’s second choice for a day/time to meet.    Meeting Day/Time 3  Your team’s last choice for a day/time to meet.       Download the Form  \nAlso please name your group. Feel free to be serious or have fun with it!\nPick one person to email me with the filled out .csv and the name of your group as the file name.\n Learning About Criteria We’ll be covering three primary concepts in evaluation: criteria, standards and indicators. While all three are extremely important, the trait that can have the greatest impact on the planning of an evaluation is in constructing the proper criteria. With that in mind, please view and listen to the Criterial and Interpretive Evaluation slideshow. You can also download a PDF of the presentation.\n You can move back and forth using ← and → and toggle fullscreen by pressing F. Just press O1 at any point in your slideshow and a display of all slides, called tile view, will appear. Click on a slide to go there or press O to exit tile view.

Similar to a viewpoint on statistics and methodology in general, this view can create situations where practitioners try to pigeonhole an evaluation to fit some predefined framework. Evaluation is not a these models fit all kind of field. However, one of the most utilized frameworks - the CIPP Model - is mentioned in the EVCC and should you perform any evaluation work in the future, it is likely that you will at least hear it being mentioned. With that said, its not a bad idea to have a look.\n Learning About Surveys Some of you will no doubt be utilizing survey instruments within your evaluation. However constructing meaningful surveys can be quite difficult and response rates can be affected by anything from wording to distribution times to aesthetics. While this is certainly not a survey development course, please view and listen to the Survey Design slideshow.

Online  Slack   Contacting me Slack is the best way to get in contact with me. Response times are typically much quicker than the standard 24-48 hours given to emails. Please remember that life is still chaotic at this time!\n  Course objectives Students will be expected to develop the following knowledge, skills, and abilities, including but not limited to:\nAcquiring knowledge of basic models and principles of program evaluation Developing an understanding of program evaluation practice by designing and conducting an evaluation of a program relevant to their degree and individual interests. Learning how to write an evaluation report to meet stakeholder information and decision-making needs Explaining the different types and uses of variables in a research study. Gaining an understanding of ethical, social, political, and cultural issues confronted by program evaluators.   FAQ Is the course content difficult? You’ve probably heard an answer like this before: At times some of the material can be dense. Well that isn’t much of a response. Difficulty is not the issue here since as humans with differing educational background, we will have strengths in some areas more than others. Instead the question is can you identify areas that need strengthened and communicate them? If you can, then you have a good shot at succeeding in this class.\n Is there a lot of theory? Evaluation is a practice based field so much of what you will come across will align with that notion. With that said, while I have tried to get rid of any and all theory, some basic concepts need an underlying construct or idea.\n What if I find a mistake? Tell me! I strive to be error free but like everyone else, make silly mistakes. This includes grammar and spelling errors as well!\n  Course materials There are two texts, though you will receive some supplementary materials in the course as well.\nTexts Required We’ll rely on the texts below. Both are available through the WVU library WVU library:\n Davidson, E. J. (2007). Evaluation methodology basics: The nuts and bolts of sound evaluation (1st ed.). SAGE.  Digital edition (free!) Hardcover edition (not free) - ISBN: 9780761729307  American Psychological Association. (2020). Publication manual of the American Psychological Association (7th ed.). (ISBN: 978-1433832161)  Spiral bound edition (not free though the WVU library have copies of the official paperback variant - ISBN: 978143383217    Optional  Mertens, D. M. (2018). Mixed methods design in evaluation. SAGE.  There will occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the content page for that session.\n  Software Quatrics You will need access to your WVU Qualtrics account. Please go to the site and check if you can login. If you are enrolled as a WVU student, then you should have access. However if you do not, submit a ticket to IT or give them a ring at 304-293-4444.\n R and RStudio (Optional) Again, this is totally optional but may interest some of you. If this is the case, please let me know and I will add you to the training modules.\nWhile required for most of the methods courses I teach, you have the option in this course to learn about the open source (and free!)statistical platform R via the software RStudio. You can think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard — R handles all the calculations produces the actual statistics and graphical output, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code. Please note that\nyou do not need to have any programming experience to use R\n R is free, but it can sometimes be a task to install and configure. To make life easier, you can opt to use the free RStudio.cloud service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This is recommended for those of you who do not want to install programs right now or just wabt to test it out.\nThe service is convenient, but please keep in mind that it can be slow and is not designed to handle large data sets or more complicated analysis and graphics. You also cannot customize much with RStudio.cloud. As you learn more, you’ll want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud.\nYou can find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.\n  Note: Online help Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and its always the tiny errors in your coding can result in tons of headache. People working in any syntax based software package at any level experience this!\nBut there are multiple resources online to help.\n First you will have access to Data Camp which allows you to relieve professional training that otherwise costs a lot of money. Is it perfect and flashy? Nope but it is interactive and if you pay attention, then R’s initial steep learning curve won’t feel much like an uphill battle.\n Second two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q\u0026amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)). I freely admit that StackOverflow has saved me multiple hours of frustration. Just note if you have a syntax or process issue, both sites require you to produce a minimally reproducible example.\n Third using Twitter you can post R-related questions and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.\n Fourth searching for help with R on Google (or another indexed search site) can sometimes be tricky because the program name is,for a lack of a better explanation, a single letter.\n Fifth we have a class chatroom at Slack where you can poise a question. I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond quickly. (This is a rare instances where I keep notifications on so please utilize it!) Ask questions about the readings, exercises, and mini projects. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too.\n Sixth and lastly you can send items by Slack or email me with questions about content, R or whatever (after giving a graduate student effort of course). Please include the subject header EDP 617 “the title of your email” where the title of your email is given without the quotes. If you do email me, please include the following:\n A brief description of the problem and what you have done thus far including the line number of the issue (if applicable). A copy of your data set (if applicable). A copy of your script or Rmarkdown document with comments throughout so I know what you’ve tried historically leading up to the issue.   I have a mail filter that will automatically bring your email to a top priority status.1\nYou should absolutely expect to struggle at times, but there is no better and more satisfying feeling than figuring things out for yourself! In the long run, you’re more likely to remember things you’ve figured out rather than those you’ve been shown or told.\n  Assignments and Grades You can find up to date descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page.\n   Percent  Assignment      15  Weekly Tasks    15  Synchronous Meetings    5  Evaluation Prospectus    20  Needs Assessment    15  Evaluation Proposal    25  Final Report    5  Presentation of Results      \n   Grade  Range      A  90–100%    B  80%-89%    C  70–79%    D  60–69%    F  \u0026lt; 60%      \nAll materials are due on a weekly basis by Sunday at 11:59 PM unless otherwise noted. New material will be posted on the course website by Tuesday afternoon by 12:00 PM.\nYour hours Please watch this video:\n Your hours (formerly known as office hours) are set times dedicated to you the student!2). This means that I will be in my office at home waiting for you to come by talk to me remotely with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.\nBecause of the pandemic, we cannot meet in person. I can meet you online via Zoom. You can request a meeting through the calendar, e-mail or Slack.\n Class conduct and expectations Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up with or stole from other professors:\n Late work: Barring the three main course tasks, past due deliverables will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via eCampus. There are no exceptions to this policy. Please note that I will not accept coursework by email or any other means.\n Participation: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate in class. Engagement is mostly defined by you—if that means commenting and answering questions, neat; if it means sitting quietly and being focused, also neat; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off, not so neat.\n Justifications: On any submission, you must justiofy any assertion. I don’t know what you know so its your job to provide all of the necessary evidence to convince me that you do know what you say you know. While you’ve probably heard this multiple times over your life, think of it this way: if someone tells you that not only is the Earth flat, the core is actually made out of tiramisu and moscato, the first question you should be asking is what’s your evidence? possibly followed by is the core delicious?.\n Rubrics: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level, I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:\nWhen writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), a rubric isn’t often provided. If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up). Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor. Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!   Technology use: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. We’re all adults3.\n My philosophy:\nJust assume that all submissions are formal and must be submitted with the appropriate use of language, grammar, syntax, etc. and follow standard APA 7th edition formatting guidelines where applicable. People who are easily offended by content, believe their work to be flawless or are generally unable to handle criticism should consider looking at another course. If you want rainbows and ponies, consider another class. If you care about data, fieldwork and learning a highly marketable practice, you’ve come to the right place. There is a great deal of content in this course and you will likely struggle with some at times. Given that, there is also something to be said about the satisfaction a person gets when figuring something out, but nowhere is it written that has to be on your own. You may find that a nudge here or there elicits the same feeling so please reach out for help.    Learning and knowledge during a pandemic When course objectives are written explicitly and clearly, they provide the information you need to figure out what a student should be able to do by the end of a given term. In fact, professors often test your proficiency in an area through multiple assessments such as exams, papers, presentations, etc where you are essentially asked to show us what you have learned. However learning is not the same as knowledge .\nTo save you from a long philosophical narrative on epistemology, in a nutshell we humans aren’t that good at evaluating a person’s knowledge mainly because its not a well-defined concept. With that said, we believe one indicator of knowledge is in a person’s ability to successfully explain a high level concept in such a way that the lay person can understand it. Every so often, consider asking yourself this:\nCan I describe whatever using language so that anyone could understand it?\n On top of what’s noted above and I’m not sure how to articulate this any better - life sucks right now! It is likely by now you know people who have been hospitalized or passed away, lost their jobs, and/or tested positive for COVID-19. Additionally stresses in life are up. Given this, here is my promise to you:\nIf you keep an open line, show initiative, and let me know ahead of time if something is going not according to plan4, I will do everything I can to help you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class!\n   Course policies Its pretty simple: Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat. Stay in touch. Be a good human.\n We will also follow WVU’s Code of Conduct.\nThis syllabus reflects a plan for the term but things change and plans change. so deviations may become necessary as we move along during the term. Note that I reserve the right to alter or amend this syllabus and will send notifications if course tasks are affected.\n COVID-19 Statement WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.\nIn a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe the social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines set by the University at all times. While in class, students will sit in assigned seats when applicable and wear the required PPE. Should a student forget to bring the required PPE, PPE will be available in the building for students to acquire. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.\nIf a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes.\nPsychological and Psychiatric Services Life at WVU can be complicated and challenging, especially during a pandemic! You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. Psychological and Psychiatric Services provides free, confidential support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The office is staffed by professional counselors and psychiatrists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students. Please do not hesitate to contact them for assistance—getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n CARE Team If you or anyone you know may be at-risk such as those listed here, please make a CARE referral. You may do so directly at the main WVU CARE TEAM site.\n Lauren’s Promise I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\n Lauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or the Campus Police at 304-293-3136.\nIf you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call/text a private Title IX On-Call Line 304-906-9930.\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at West Virginia University. WVU has instituted procedures to respond to violations of these laws and standards, programs aimed at the prevention of such conduct, and intervention on behalf of the victims.\n Academic Integrity The integrity of the classes offered by any academic institution solidifies the foundation of its mission and cannot be sacrificed to expediency, ignorance, or blatant fraud. Therefore, I will enforce rigorous standards of academic integrity in all aspects and assignments of this course. For the detailed policy of West Virginia University regarding the definitions of acts considered to fall under academic dishonesty and possible ensuing sanctions, please see the West Virginia University Academic Catalog at http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. Should you have any questions about possibly improper research citations or references, or any other activity that may be interpreted as an attempt at academic dishonesty, please see me before the assignment is due to discuss the matter.\n Inclusivity Statement The West Virginia University community is committed to creating and fostering a positive learning and working environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and inclusion.\nIf you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of accommodation in order to participate in this class, please advise me and make appropriate arrangements with the Office of Accessibility Services (304-293-6700).\nFor more information on West Virginia University’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, please see http://diversity.wvu.edu.\n Incomplete Grades Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term. If the instructor agrees, the instructor and the student must negotiate the conditions under which the grade of I will be changed to a letter grade and sign a contract. The date to submit the incomplete work should not be set beyond the last day of class of the following semester. If the student does not complete the terms of contract, then the instructor should submit a grade of F. All incomplete contracts must be filed with the department and Dean’s Office. See the policy at [Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term. If the instructor agrees, the instructor and the student must negotiate the conditions under which the grade of I will be changed to a letter grade and sign a contract.

See the policy at http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/enrollmentandregistration/#gradestext.\n Sale of Course Materials All course materials, including lectures, class notes, quizzes, exams, handouts, presentations, and other materials provided to students for this course are protected under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Please review the sharing and editing restrictions prior to distributing or amending any material on this site. As such, the unauthorized purchase or sale of these materials may result in disciplinary sanctions under the Campus Student Code. Basically you can share what you like but don’t try to make a buck.\n Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI) Effective teaching is a primary mission of West Virginia University. Student evaluation of instruction provides the university and the instructor with feedback about your experiences in the course for review and course improvement. Your participation in the evaluation of course instruction is both strongly encouraged and highly valued. Results are strictly confidential, anonymous, and not available to the instructor until after final grades are released by Admissions and Records. Information about how you can complete this evaluation will be provided later.\n University Attendance Policy At West Virginia University, class attendance contributes significantly to academic success. Students who attend classes regularly tend to earn higher grades and have higher passing rates in courses. Excessive absences may jeopardize students’ grades or even their ability to continue in their courses. There is a strong correlation between regular class attendance and academic success.\n Course Netiquette The basic premise is that the etiquette expected of students in the online environment is the same as that expected in a classroom. Common courtesy is the guiding rule of Internet communications. Be prepared to communicate effectively when taking an online course. Following these simple netiquette rules in your online class or education environment will ensure your success:\n Include a professional salutation. In this case, “Hello Dr. Roy” or “Dear Dr. Roy” is appropriate. Include a proper ending such as “Thank you” or “With regards.” Then type in your full name. Never type in ALL CAPS, because it reads as if you ARE SHOUTING AT PEOPLE. Act as professionally, via your writing, as you would in a face to face classroom. Refrain from inappropriate language and derogatory or personal attacks. Do not dominate any discussion. Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion. Disagree with ideas but avoid challenges that may be interpreted as a personal attack. Check that you are replying to the specific person you intend, and not to the entire class. Never give your password to another person. Respect the virtual classroom. Never forward in-class communications or posts by others outside of this virtual space. Never spam your classmates. If you quote someone’s previous post, only quote enough to make your point.  Be aware of the University’s Academic Integrity and Dishonesty Policy http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. You can review the rules, regulations, and procedures concerning student conduct and discipline for the main campus of West Virginia University, at http://campuslife.wvu.edu/r/download/1802350.\n Response Time I generally respond to Slack queries in the same day while responses to emails and discussion posts are within 48 hours, except during holidays. Often, I will reply much more quickly but you should not count on a immediate. Please plan accordingly so that you don’t miss deadlines! I generally return assignments within one to two weeks after a final submission date.\n Technical Requirements Students need to have access to a computer for word processing, e-mail and access to eCampus. Access to the Internet is necessary for completion of this course. Run the Browser Check. This tool will check that you are using a supported Internet browser and have a valid Java version installed. The required technical skills to participate in this course are:\nNavigate the web Use email with attachments Create and submit files in commonly used word processing program formats Copy and paste Download and install software Consult software tutorials and other online sources as a method of learning software features Use syntax when necessary   Technical Support Technical support regarding your use of eCampus is available by contacting 304-293-4444 (telephone), 1-877-327-9260 (toll free number), itshelp@mail.wvu.edu (email), and/or http://it.wvu.edu (website).\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n   In this new normal, I receive an overwhelming number of emails per day and may miss yours if the header is not formatted properly.↩︎\n There is some misunderstanding about what office hours actually are!
