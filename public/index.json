Each type of assignment in this class helps with at least one one of these criteria.\nReflections To encourage engagement with the course content, you’ll need to write a ~150 word reflection about the readings for the day. That’s fairly short: there are ~250 words on a typical double-spaced page in Microsoft Word (500 when single-spaced).\nYou can do a lot of different things with this memo: discuss something you learned from the course content, write about the best or worst type of measure you’ve seen, connect the course content to your own work, etc. These reflections let you explore and answer some of the key questions of this course, including:\n What is measurement? Why do we measure? Can everything be measured? Should everything be measured? What makes up a valid and reliable measure? What makes up a poor measure? How do you choose which type of measure to use?  The course content for each day will also include a set of questions specific to that topic. You do not have to answer all (or any) of these questions. That would be impossible. They exist to guide your thinking, that’s all.\nI will grade these memos using a check system:\n ✔+: (11.5 points (115%) in gradebook) Reflection shows phenomenal thought and engagement with the course content. I will not assign these often. ✔: (10 points (100%) in gradebook) Reflection is thoughtful, well-written, and shows engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance. ✔−: (5 points (50%) in gradebook) Reflection is hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.  Everything else is scored as a 0 which should signal that this is essentially a scaled completion-based system. I am not grading your writing ability, counting the exact number of words you’re writing, or looking for citations from the reading(s). I am looking for thoughtful engagement and that’s it! Do good work and you’ll earn a ✓.\nYou will turn these reflections on the Discussion Board on eCampus.\n Exercises Each class session has interactive lessons and fully annotated examples of code that teach and demonstrate how to do specific tasks in R via Data Camp. You can easily find answers online but without practicing these foundational aspects of R, you may have trouble later! Note that this is also essentially a pass/fail system:\n ✔+: (11.5 points (115%) in gradebook) Exercises are 100% completed. Every task was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Knitted document is clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often. ✔: (10 points (100%) in gradebook) Exercises are 70–99% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. ✔−: (5 points (50%) in gradebook) Exercises are less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.  Again, I am not grading your coding ability, checking each line of code or syntax to make sure it produces the exact output, and most importantly, I am not looking for perfection! Try hard, get frustrated, do good work and you’ll get a ✓.\nI encourage you to work together on the courses if possible, but you must turn in your own work on Data Camp.\n Situations To give you practice with the data and design principles you’ll learn in this class, you will complete three mini projects consisting of situations that necessitate some concept related to assessment and measurement. I will provide you with real-world data and pose one or more questions—you will answer those questions. Sometimes this involves just answering using what you’ve learnt while others involve using R to assess data.\nThe submissions will be graded using a check system:\n ✔+: (85 points (≈115%) in gradebook) Project is phenomenally well-designed and uses advanced R techniques. The project uncovers an important story that is not readily apparent from just looking at the raw data. I will not assign these often. ✔: (75 points (100%) in gradebook) Project is fine, follows most design principles, answers a question from the data, and uses R correctly. This is the expected level of performance. ✔−: (37.5 points (50%) in gradebook) Project is missing large components, is poorly designed, does not answer a relevant question, and/or uses R incorrectly. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.  Because these tasks give you practice for the final project, I will provide you with extensive feedback on your submissions.\n Final project At the end of the course, you will demonstrate your data visualization skills by completing a final project.\nComplete details for the final project will be posted here at the halfway point through the course. To preview, you will\nDevelop a test with items. Conduct assessments addressing the test’s validity and reliability including performing a factor analysis.  This project serves as your final exam.\nThe project will not be graded using a check system. If you’ve engaged with the course content and completed the exercises and mini projects throughout the course, you should do just fine with the final project.\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3aa23ffb1eb3dedbe4d8a9c2165e2c58","permalink":"/assignment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/","section":"assignment","summary":"Reflections Exercises Situations Final project   You will get the most of out this class if you:\nengage with the readings and materials, use R to complete any analysis, ask for help immediately after giving it (whatever it is) a good faith effort, and keep an open and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.","tags":null,"title":"Assignment overview","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Each class session has a set of required readings that you should complete before doing anything else.\nI’ve included a set of questions that might guide your reflection response.

Head over to The Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University to take a look.\n Logic Models Logic models are simply a visual(ish) way to depict the moving parts of a program. Once constructed, it is a fairly easy way to guide parts of an evaluation and for stakeholders to see if changes need to occur. The Program Development and Evaluation supported by the University of Wisconsin Extension Program is a fantastic resource for all things logic model.\n A Whole Lot of Methods Being an evaluator is akin to “being a jack of all trades but a master of none.” That is not meant to be demeaning in any way (or else I’d just be putting myself down). We are typically methodologists and/or have an innate ability to construct studies to determine the needs of a program. However evaluators are rarely content experts and even if we are, the likelihood of evaluating something within our content is pretty low.

Sometimes the descriptions and/or examples aren’t very helpful, but most of the time you should be able to find the information you are looking for.\nExpectations If you skim through this, you may notice that all of the outputs are already done for you. I strongly encourage you to take some time to go through these walkthroughs and to ask questions as needed! Much like any other language, R requires fluency but that cannot occur without a good foundation.\n Prerequisites In this session, we will use the tidyverse and fivethirtyeight packages. If you have loaded the former, then please skip ahead to the next paragraph. If not, please select Tools \u0026gt; Install Packages and then type in tidyverse and ensure that Install dependencies is selected or simply run the following in your console.\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;, dependencies = TRUE) followed by\nlibrary(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) to load the family. Now try doing the same for fivethirtyeight by running\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;fivethirtyeight\u0026quot;, dependencies = TRUE) followed by\nlibrary(\u0026quot;fivethirtyeight\u0026quot;) Please note that once a package is on your computer, you never have to install it again unless it is somehow deleted. This means from now on you will only have to use the second command library(\"WHATEVER PACKAGE YOU ALREADY HAVE DOWNLOADED\") to use that package.\nBefore moving on, here is a good place to reiterate how you can use ? to find more information. When you look at the package list for fiverthirtyeight, not all of the names do a great job of describing what that data set consists of. To see this, type in fiverthirtyeight:: and scroll through the pop up list of available data sets and commands. Let’s say the data set tarantino caught your eye but you weren’t really sure what it consisted of. Hovering over the set in that pop up list tells you that it contains data behind the story A Complete Catalog Of Every Time Someone Cursed Or Bled Out In A Quentin Tarantino Movie.\nOK well that’s a good start but to be able to do anything with that data, we really need to know what its variables are. To do this, run the command below\n?tarantino You should have noticed the Help tab on the lower right hand window is prominent and there is a significant amount of information explaining the data set including the variable names and corresponding descriptions.\n Data Files Data sets used in R are typically accessible in one of two ways.\nThey can be distributed within R packages. These are often smaller data sets used in examples, interactive guides, or tutorials within packages. These are loaded with the data() function. For example you can load UN data on demographic statistics from the fivethirtyeight library, which has plenty of data sets used by the poll analysis site FiveThirtyEight. To see the entire list, you can run the command data(). In this case, the drinks data set looks like something I may want to look at. To view the data set, run  data(\u0026quot;drinks\u0026quot;, package = \u0026quot;fivethirtyeight\u0026quot;) followed by\ndrinks ## # A tibble: 193 x 5 ## country beer_servings spirit_servings wine_servings total_litres_of_pur… ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 0 0 0 0 ## 2 Albania 89 132 54 4.9 ## 3 Algeria 25 0 14 0.7 ## 4 Andorra 245 138 312 12.4 ## 5 Angola 217 57 45 5.9 ## 6 Antigua \u0026amp; B… 102 128 45 4.9 ## 7 Argentina 193 25 221 8.3 ## 8 Armenia 21 179 11 3.8 ## 9 Australia 261 72 212 10.4 ## 10 Austria 279 75 191 9.7 ## # … with 183 more rows They can be loaded from external files including both stored R file formats .RData and .rda, and other more familiar formats such as .csv and .sav. In this session, we’ll look at reading and writing a csv file using R by enabling the commands read_csv and write_csv from the readr library (which is a part of tidyverse so you don’t have to load it separately).  The drinks data set can also be found here. As long as data is somewhere and accessible, chances are R can get it! For example, we can use the read_csv command to get the data we need like so\ndrinks \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv\u0026quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## country = col_character(), ## beer_servings = col_double(), ## spirit_servings = col_double(), ## wine_servings = col_double(), ## total_litres_of_pure_alcohol = col_double() ## ) followed by\ndrinks ## # A tibble: 193 x 5 ## country beer_servings spirit_servings wine_servings total_litres_of_pur… ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 0 0 0 0 ## 2 Albania 89 132 54 4.9 ## 3 Algeria 25 0 14 0.7 ## 4 Andorra 245 138 312 12.4 ## 5 Angola 217 57 45 5.9 ## 6 Antigua \u0026amp; B… 102 128 45 4.9 ## 7 Argentina 193 25 221 8.3 ## 8 Armenia 21 179 11 3.8 ## 9 Australia 261 72 212 10.4 ## 10 Austria 279 75 191 9.7 ## # … with 183 more rows As you can see from the outputs are identical. While you were typing you may have noticed that that there is a read.csv() and read_csv(). The former is what we call a base command, or one that is pre-built into R. However, you will want to stick to the latter which is from the readr package for many reasons we will get into later on, but for now just know it is a bit faster and returns a tibble instead of a data frame which is far easier to work with! You can check what type of variable you have by using class() on it. For example, the following\nclass(drinks) ## [1] \u0026quot;spec_tbl_df\u0026quot; \u0026quot;tbl_df\u0026quot; \u0026quot;tbl\u0026quot; \u0026quot;data.frame\u0026quot; tells us that we not only have a data frame, but a tibble as well as well as some other formats we’ll ignore for the time being. If you want more information, please see R for Data Science Ch 10: Tibbles.\nNote that we loaded the file directly from a web address URL, but say you had it as a local file on your computer in the same directory as your R script. The command\ndrinks \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;drinks.csv\u0026quot;) drinks would work just as well.\nChopping a Data Set Up You may already know that the single bracket, [, is useful to select rows and columns in simple cases.\ndrinks[c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), ] ## # A tibble: 5 x 5 ## country beer_servings spirit_servings wine_servings total_litres_of_pure_a… ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Afghanist… 0 0 0 0 ## 2 Albania 89 132 54 4.9 ## 3 Algeria 25 0 14 0.7 ## 4 Andorra 245 138 312 12.4 ## 5 Angola 217 57 45 5.9 There are tidyverse options to handle this via the package dplyr to select rows by number, to select rows by certain criteria, or to select columns.\nFor example, to select rows 1–5, we can use the slice() command.\nslice(drinks, 1:5) ## # A tibble: 5 x 5 ## country beer_servings spirit_servings wine_servings total_litres_of_pure_a… ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Afghanist… 0 0 0 0 ## 2 Albania 89 132 54 4.9 ## 3 Algeria 25 0 14 0.7 ## 4 Andorra 245 138 312 12.4 ## 5 Angola 217 57 45 5.9 Base R allows you to choose the column beer_servings from the drinks data frame in a number of ways. For example, each of the following\ndrinks[, \u0026quot;beer_servings\u0026quot;] drinks$beer_servings drinks[[\u0026quot;beer_servings\u0026quot;]] yields\n## [1] 0 89 25 245 217 102 193 21 261 279 21 122 42 0 143 142 295 263 ## [19] 34 23 167 76 173 245 31 231 25 88 37 144 57 147 240 17 15 130 ## [37] 79 159 1 76 0 149 230 93 192 361 0 32 224 15 52 193 162 6 ## [55] 52 92 18 224 20 77 263 127 347 8 52 346 31 133 199 53 9 28 ## [73] 93 1 69 234 233 9 5 0 9 313 63 85 82 77 6 124 58 21 ## [91] 0 31 62 281 20 82 19 0 343 236 26 8 13 0 5 149 0 0 ## [109] 98 238 62 0 77 31 12 47 5 376 49 5 251 203 78 3 42 188 ## [127] 169 22 0 306 285 44 213 163 71 343 194 1 140 109 297 247 43 194 ## [145] 171 120 105 0 56 0 9 283 157 25 60 196 270 56 0 225 284 16 ## [163] 8 128 90 152 185 5 2 99 106 1 36 36 197 51 51 19 6 45 ## [181] 206 16 219 36 249 115 25 21 333 111 6 32 64 Unlike [, the [[ and $ operators can only select a single column and return a vector.1 The dplyr function select() always returns a tibble, and never a vector, even if only one column is selected.\nFor example, note that selecting rows 1–5 of the beer_servings column using base R gives us a vector.\ndrinks[1:5, \u0026quot;beer_servings\u0026quot;] ## # A tibble: 5 x 1 ## beer_servings ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 0 ## 2 89 ## 3 25 ## 4 245 ## 5 217 Whereas in the dplyr world, the same series of functions can be performed using a pipe operator: %\u0026gt;% which retains the table like format.\ndrinks %\u0026gt;% slice(1:5) %\u0026gt;% select(beer_servings) ## # A tibble: 5 x 1 ## beer_servings ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 0 ## 2 89 ## 3 25 ## 4 245 ## 5 217 This example may seem verbose, but later we can produce more complicated transformations of the data by chaining together simple functions. For example, it is far easier to use them to select multiple columns like so\ndrinks %\u0026gt;% slice(1:5) %\u0026gt;% select(country, beer_servings) ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## country beer_servings ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 0 ## 2 Albania 89 ## 3 Algeria 25 ## 4 Andorra 245 ## 5 Angola 217 or to get rid of a column\ndrinks %\u0026gt;% slice(1:5) %\u0026gt;% select(-spirit_servings) ## # A tibble: 5 x 4 ## country beer_servings wine_servings total_litres_of_pure_alcohol ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 0 0 0 ## 2 Albania 89 54 4.9 ## 3 Algeria 25 14 0.7 ## 4 Andorra 245 312 12.4 ## 5 Angola 217 45 5.9 We’ll talk more about pipes next week!\n Saving Objects There are two types of saves you should consider at this point\n The workspace save An output save  The workspace save is everything you see in your RStudio window (e.g. the syntax, script, outputs, etc). When you close out of RStudio, you may be asked to save your workspace which essentially means the next time you load a saved script up, you’ll pick up exactly where you left off.\nWhile convenient, it is not recommended that do this. Like rebooting a computer, you really want to have a fresh start every time RStudio starts up. While certainly not mandated, you never know what piece of rogue commands could have affected your progress when you last saved the file. Opting not to save an image of your workspace removes all of the previous commands while keeping your script intact.\nAn output save occurs when you are trying to save a data set or result in a particular format. Firstly, you have to ensure that you have both downloaded and loaded a necessary package. For example, base R does not have an ability to read in and flatten SPSS files. However, installing and enabling the package foreign makes both reading in and writing to SPSS a cinch.\nLet’s say we want to export our drinks output to a csv file. Well luckily we have the package readr already loaded and it has the command write_csv() that does exactly what we want. The command requires that you note the variable name, drinks, and what you want to call it which in this case I am calling new_drinks.csv. If you are wondering, you absolutely have to out the format type at the end.\nwrite_csv(drinks, \u0026quot;new_drinks.csv\u0026quot;) Well that’s great but say we wanted to save it as a SPSS file. Running\n?write_csv doesn’t yield any information about saving any data set or output as a SPSS file. If we run a simple Google search (e.g. with the terms save SPSS R tidy) and click on the first link, it seems like a package called haven both saves a data frame as a SPSS file and is tidy as well which the package foreign I mentioned earlier does not. While the latter condition isn’t required, having packages that do keep your data tidy will make your life so much easier! Now we can just do the following\nwrite_sav(drinks, \u0026quot;new_drinks.sav\u0026quot;)  Now you are free to go use SPSS for some reason.\n Style Guide Following a consistent coding style is important for your code to be readable by you and others. The preferred style is the tidyverse style guide, which differs slightly from Google’s R style guide.\n The lintr package will check files for style errors.\n The styler package provides functions for automatically formatting R code according to style guides.\n  You will be expected to turn in a script with any submission where R is needed. Much like any writing, if your script is easy to read, then it is most likely easy to grade. A messy script without comments, spacing, and style may lead to misunderstandings. Long story short: make it look good and easy to interpret and your score will reflect that!\nIf you want a warning about styling your script, open RStudio and go to the Tools \u0026gt; Global Options \u0026gt; Code \u0026gt; Diagnostics pane. Then check the box to activate style warnings. On this pane, there are other options that can be set in order to increase or decrease the amount of warnings while writing in RStudio.\n    Please see the discussion in R for DataScience on how tibble objects differ from base data.frame objects in how the single bracket [ is handled.↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ce879375c9ab42490f4d0d112e48c07c","permalink":"/example/02-example/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/example/02-example/","section":"example","summary":"Introduction Expectations Prerequisites Data Files Chopping a Data Set Up Saving Objects Style Guide     Introduction First things first, once a package has been loaded, you can use a ?","tags":null,"title":"How Data Doesn't Care About Your Beliefs or Feelings and Other Obviuous Observations I've Had to Tell People for Some Reason","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" This week please complete both the Introduction to the Tidyverse and Exploratory Data Analysis in R courses on Data Camp which includes\n Data wrangling Data visualization Grouping and summarizing Types of visualizations  Exploring Categorical Data Exploring Numerical Data Numerical Summaries Case Study (case study of email spam)  respectively.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"911ebe9376618b75c6ca9ac02110b8b9","permalink":"/lesson/02-lesson/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lesson/02-lesson/","section":"lesson","summary":"This week please complete both the Introduction to the Tidyverse and Exploratory Data Analysis in R courses on Data Camp which includes\n Data wrangling Data visualization Grouping and summarizing Types of visualizations  Exploring Categorical Data Exploring Numerical Data Numerical Summaries Case Study (case study of email spam)  respectively.","tags":null,"title":"Wait I Have to Clean my Room and my Data?

The full data set is a huge file with 1 million answers to the 50 personality items! You can access it here but be warned that opening a file that size can take a long time or may even crash some computers depending on their processing power and RAM. It is a tab separated csv file.\nSide Note I am not certain how to load it in Excel but in R you can use\ntoobig_five_data \u0026lt;- read_delim(\u0026quot;data-final.csv\u0026quot;, delim=\u0026quot;\\t\u0026quot;)  to save it to the big_five_data variable which you can access by running\ntoobig_five_data At this point you probably want to just open up the csv files in Excel and if that is what works, then by all means. While I try to run everything in R, sometimes its just easier to double click it. The problem really lies in the size of a data set. The larger the data set, the more power and time it takes for excel to load it up both into its program and to show it to you. Its really that second part that’s the killer! With R you avoid the latter step which means your data set loads up within seconds, rather than minutes. If you try loading the original data set in both R and Excel, the difference is very apparent.\nIn any case, we will be working with data strictly in R but never feel bad about opening a data set using another application like Excel. For all of my snarkiness towards anything Office, Excel has some nice qualities.\n  Loading a Local Data Set Let’s load the data set, codebook, and measures\nbig_five_data \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;Big5data.csv\u0026quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## .default = col_double() ## ) ## See spec(...) for full column specifications. big_five_codebook \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;Big5codebook.csv\u0026quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## ID = col_character(), ## Item = col_character() ## ) big_five_measures \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;Big5measures.csv\u0026quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## Measure = col_double(), ## Description = col_character() ## ) and take a look at each\nbig_five_data %\u0026gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 50 ## EXT1 EXT2 EXT3 EXT4 EXT5 EXT6 EXT7 EXT8 EXT9 EXT10 EST1 EST2 EST3 ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 3 2 3 4 4 2 3 3 4 2 4 3 5 ## 2 1 5 1 5 1 4 1 5 4 5 4 2 4 ## 3 2 5 4 3 1 5 1 3 4 5 2 5 5 ## 4 2 3 3 3 3 2 2 4 2 3 5 1 5 ## 5 3 4 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 4 3 5 3 ## 6 3 1 5 1 4 1 5 4 4 2 5 2 5 ## # … with 37 more variables: EST4 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, EST5 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, EST6 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, EST7 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # EST8 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, EST9 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, EST10 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, AGR1 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, AGR2 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, AGR3 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # AGR4 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, AGR5 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, AGR6 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, AGR7 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, AGR8 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, AGR9 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # AGR10 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, CSN1 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, CSN2 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, CSN3 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, CSN4 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, CSN5 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # CSN6 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, CSN7 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, CSN8 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, CSN9 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, CSN10 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, OPN1 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # OPN2 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, OPN3 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, OPN4 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, OPN5 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, OPN6 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, OPN7 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # OPN8 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, OPN9 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, OPN10 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; with respondents self-report under the five factors Extroversion (EXT), Agreeableness (AGR), Conscientiousness (CSN), Emotional Stability (EST), and Intellect/Imagination (OPN).\nbig_five_codebook ## # A tibble: 50 x 2 ## ID Item ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 EXT1 I am the life of the party. ## 2 EXT2 I don\u0026#39;t talk a lot. ## 3 EXT3 I feel comfortable around people. ## 4 EXT4 I keep in the background. ## 5 EXT5 I start conversations. ## 6 EXT6 I have little to say. ## 7 EXT7 I talk to a lot of different people at parties. ## 8 EXT8 I don\u0026#39;t like to draw attention to myself. ## 9 EXT9 I don\u0026#39;t mind being the center of attention. ## 10 EXT10 I am quiet around strangers. ## # … with 40 more rows big_five_measures ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## Measure Description ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 5 Agree ## 2 4 Somewhat Agree ## 3 3 Neutral ## 4 2 Somewhat Disagree ## 5 1 Disagree For this walkthrough, let’s just concentrate on the Extroversion items which are given by EXT. That means we should probably pair down both the data set and codebook. For data sets with multiple columns, we can use the select() syntax. Moreover since we are looking at all of the columns that have EXT, we can pull only those using the starts_with() command. For more examples of options that can be used with select(), take a look here.\nbig_five_data_EXT \u0026lt;- big_five_data %\u0026gt;% select(starts_with(\u0026quot;EXT\u0026quot;)) and then we’ll do something similar to the codebook. While we can’t simply select columns because all of the variables are in a single column. Much like in Excel, we can filter rows. To do this in R, we use the filter() command.\nbig_five_codebook_EXT \u0026lt;- big_five_codebook %\u0026gt;% filter(str_detect(ID, \u0026quot;EXT\u0026quot;)) big_five_data_EXT ## # A tibble: 100 x 10 ## EXT1 EXT2 EXT3 EXT4 EXT5 EXT6 EXT7 EXT8 EXT9 EXT10 ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 3 2 3 4 4 2 3 3 4 2 ## 2 1 5 1 5 1 4 1 5 4 5 ## 3 2 5 4 3 1 5 1 3 4 5 ## 4 2 3 3 3 3 2 2 4 2 3 ## 5 3 4 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 4 ## 6 3 1 5 1 4 1 5 4 4 2 ## 7 3 3 4 2 5 2 5 2 4 3 ## 8 3 4 1 3 0 4 1 4 2 5 ## 9 2 4 2 4 4 1 3 1 2 5 ## 10 3 4 4 2 3 2 3 5 1 4 ## # … with 90 more rows big_five_codebook_EXT ## # A tibble: 10 x 2 ## ID Item ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 EXT1 I am the life of the party. ## 2 EXT2 I don\u0026#39;t talk a lot. ## 3 EXT3 I feel comfortable around people. ## 4 EXT4 I keep in the background. ## 5 EXT5 I start conversations. ## 6 EXT6 I have little to say. ## 7 EXT7 I talk to a lot of different people at parties. ## 8 EXT8 I don\u0026#39;t like to draw attention to myself. ## 9 EXT9 I don\u0026#39;t mind being the center of attention. ## 10 EXT10 I am quiet around strangers.  Reverse Coding Sometimes items can be worded ‘backwards’. In these situation, scales need to be reversed to point in the same direction.\nExample For example both these questions might be used to measure the same underlying construct or idea.\nI really like being alone I really don’t enjoy large gatherings  In this situation, if we used the same response scale for each participants’ responses they would simply cancel out.\nWhen aligning the direction, we typically reverse code the one that has a negative, aka the negatively-keyed item. In this case is the second example since it includes the word don’t. There are exceptions to this rule, but they are narrowly defined. For example, someone who states that they “really don’t enjoy large gatherings” doesn’t automatically imply they like being alone. In fact, there are arguably an infinite number of possibilities of things they do like! The only time you can be code all items in either direction are in circumstances where there is a binary choice (e.g. Yes/No questions).\nBut wait…there’s more! You also have to consider the intent of the questions and the participants. This second and final check is crucial to reporting reliable and consistent results.\n:::\nGetting back to the main data set, let’s again look at the codebook.\nbig_five_codebook_EXT ## # A tibble: 10 x 2 ## ID Item ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 EXT1 I am the life of the party. ## 2 EXT2 I don\u0026#39;t talk a lot. ## 3 EXT3 I feel comfortable around people. ## 4 EXT4 I keep in the background. ## 5 EXT5 I start conversations. ## 6 EXT6 I have little to say. ## 7 EXT7 I talk to a lot of different people at parties. ## 8 EXT8 I don\u0026#39;t like to draw attention to myself. ## 9 EXT9 I don\u0026#39;t mind being the center of attention. ## 10 EXT10 I am quiet around strangers. Well it certainly looks like EXT2, EXT4, EXT6, EXT8 and EXT10 are all negative in the context of of assessing extroversion. Furthermore while EXT9 includes the term don’t, it doesn’t orient the statement in a negative way so it stays the way it is.\nRemember that command we needed from the surveytools2 package? Well it was to reverse code in a tidy way\nbig_five_data_EXT_rev \u0026lt;- big_five_data_EXT %\u0026gt;% mutate(EXT2 = reverse_code(EXT2), EXT4 = reverse_code(EXT4), EXT6 = reverse_code(EXT6), EXT8 = reverse_code(EXT8), EXT10 = reverse_code(EXT10)) big_five_data_EXT_rev ## # A tibble: 100 x 10 ## EXT1 EXT2 EXT3 EXT4 EXT5 EXT6 EXT7 EXT8 EXT9 EXT10 ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 3 4 3 1 4 3 3 2 4 3 ## 2 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 4 0 ## 3 2 1 4 2 1 0 1 2 4 0 ## 4 2 3 3 2 3 3 2 1 2 2 ## 5 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 3 3 1 ## 6 3 5 5 4 4 4 5 1 4 3 ## 7 3 3 4 3 5 3 5 3 4 2 ## 8 3 2 1 2 0 1 1 1 2 0 ## 9 2 2 2 1 4 4 3 4 2 0 ## 10 3 2 4 3 3 3 3 0 1 1 ## # … with 90 more rows Let’s take a look at a sample of the first six rows between the two tables to see if the columns were indeed reverse coded.\n  Original Data Set     EXT1  EXT2  EXT3  EXT4  EXT5  EXT6  EXT7  EXT8  EXT9  EXT10      3  2  3  4  4  2  3  3  4  2    1  5  1  5  1  4  1  5  4  5    2  5  4  3  1  5  1  3  4  5    2  3  3  3  3  2  2  4  2  3    3  4  3  3  3  3  3  2  3  4    3  1  5  1  4  1  5  4  4  2       Data Set with Reverse Coded Columns     EXT1  EXT2  EXT3  EXT4  EXT5  EXT6  EXT7  EXT8  EXT9  EXT10      3  4  3  1  4  3  3  2  4  3    1  1  1  0  1  1  1  0  4  0    2  1  4  2  1  0  1  2  4  0    2  3  3  2  3  3  2  1  2  2    3  2  3  2  3  2  3  3  3  1    3  5  5  4  4  4  5  1  4  3      That looks correct! Notice that in the green columns, the numbers flip along the neutral measure (3), or maybe a better observation is that the numerical complement is correct if adding two corresponding cells equals 5. If you have had any upper level mathematics courses, you may notice these as a modulo or mod 5 system.\n  Computing the Internal Consistency There are many approaches when assessing reliability, namely those associated with interviews, experiments, surveys, trials, etc. Internal consistency is foremost one of many existing methods used to measure reliability, and it is typically useful in assessing items (e.g from a protocol, questionnaire, test, etc). It essentially estimates to what degree total scores on an instrument would change or vary if different items were used. Here are four but really three approaches used by a majority of practitioners:\nComposite Reliability Getting a bit ahead of ourselves, composite reliability is based on the factor lodgings in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). We’ll cover this when we address CFAs soon!\n Cronbach’s alpha By far the most utilized approach, it is also very procedural which is typically viewed as beneficial by many evaluators. There are many ways to tell R to compute alpha \\(\\left(\\alpha\\right)\\) but by far the simplest may be to use the psych package\npsych::alpha(big_five_data_EXT_rev) ## ## Reliability analysis ## Call: psych::alpha(x = big_five_data_EXT_rev) ## ## raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N ase mean sd median_r ## 0.9 0.9 0.91 0.48 9.1 0.015 2.7 0.95 0.49 ## ## lower alpha upper 95% confidence boundaries ## 0.87 0.9 0.93 ## ## Reliability if an item is dropped: ## raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N alpha se var.r med.r ## EXT1 0.89 0.90 0.91 0.49 8.5 0.016 0.0123 0.50 ## EXT2 0.89 0.89 0.90 0.47 8.1 0.017 0.0115 0.49 ## EXT3 0.89 0.89 0.90 0.47 8.0 0.017 0.0111 0.49 ## EXT4 0.89 0.89 0.90 0.46 7.7 0.017 0.0126 0.45 ## EXT5 0.89 0.89 0.89 0.46 7.8 0.017 0.0098 0.46 ## EXT6 0.89 0.89 0.90 0.48 8.4 0.016 0.0104 0.49 ## EXT7 0.89 0.89 0.90 0.47 7.9 0.017 0.0119 0.46 ## EXT8 0.90 0.90 0.91 0.50 9.1 0.015 0.0092 0.50 ## EXT9 0.89 0.89 0.90 0.48 8.3 0.016 0.0128 0.50 ## EXT10 0.89 0.89 0.90 0.47 7.8 0.017 0.0120 0.47 ## ## Item statistics ## n raw.r std.r r.cor r.drop mean sd ## EXT1 100 0.67 0.67 0.61 0.59 2.8 1.2 ## EXT2 100 0.73 0.74 0.71 0.66 3.4 1.2 ## EXT3 100 0.75 0.75 0.72 0.68 3.2 1.3 ## EXT4 100 0.79 0.79 0.78 0.73 2.0 1.2 ## EXT5 100 0.79 0.79 0.78 0.73 3.3 1.3 ## EXT6 100 0.68 0.68 0.65 0.60 2.7 1.3 ## EXT7 100 0.78 0.77 0.74 0.70 2.9 1.5 ## EXT8 100 0.59 0.59 0.53 0.49 1.8 1.3 ## EXT9 100 0.71 0.71 0.67 0.63 3.3 1.3 ## EXT10 100 0.78 0.78 0.75 0.71 1.4 1.3 ## ## Non missing response frequency for each item ## 0 1 2 3 4 5 miss ## EXT1 0.01 0.18 0.19 0.34 0.21 0.07 0 ## EXT2 0.00 0.09 0.13 0.30 0.26 0.22 0 ## EXT3 0.00 0.14 0.17 0.17 0.34 0.18 0 ## EXT4 0.12 0.24 0.24 0.28 0.11 0.01 0 ## EXT5 0.02 0.11 0.13 0.20 0.38 0.16 0 ## EXT6 0.08 0.14 0.13 0.35 0.29 0.01 0 ## EXT7 0.01 0.24 0.13 0.27 0.16 0.19 0 ## EXT8 0.24 0.21 0.21 0.24 0.09 0.01 0 ## EXT9 0.01 0.11 0.20 0.15 0.33 0.20 0 ## EXT10 0.33 0.23 0.21 0.15 0.07 0.01 0 There is a lot there and most of those outcomes are useful, but for reliability we really care about the raw_alpha, or the the standardized alpha based upon the correlations.

There are other ways to assess reliability. As you move to the deliverable for this week, keep in mind that none of these could yield good measures for internal consistency. You may have to look around the internet for other R commands and packages that may be a better fit. As usual, you always have your peers and me if you get stuck!\n  Looking Ahead For a little preview of next weeks content, let’s start with a reflection. Consider if you have administered a survey at some point in your life and had an uneasy or underlying feeling that everything is working against you. Did people tell you that you’re being paranoid or its out of your control? Well you aren’t just having the jitters and you actually control the survey’s destiny as it were. Is it magic? Nope because that’s not a real thing, but it is a result of a fundamental law in nature called entropy which is a measure of randomness or disorder in a system and the Second Law of Thermodynamics (wait WHAT???) which states that entropy is forever increasing. To describe this notion, we’ll be looking at two larger concepts: threats to validity and a bit of probability.\n…stay tuned!\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"73664027ae41c739f0c70a62c901a4c5","permalink":"/example/03-example/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/example/03-example/","section":"example","summary":"Take This Read Up Data Files Prerequisites Data Files Side Note  Loading a Local Data Set Reverse Coding Example  Computing the Internal Consistency Composite Reliability Cronbach’s alpha Inter-item Correlation Item-total Correlation  Looking Ahead     Take This First things first, please go and take the Big Five Personality Test.","tags":null,"title":"Reliable?

Sign up for an account with your university email address because you will be able to download available data sets given that WVU is a member institution. 3. After logging in fully, go to the FIND DATA tab and then select FIND DATA in the drop down (that’s not confusing at all). 4. Search for a data set that both interests you and is measurable by typing in a topic. Ideally you want to find a data set that have responses that are quantified, have a scale, and that scale is consistent across multiple items. 5. After the search has completed, you may notice there are filters on the left hand side. Scroll down to Data Availibility and select Public Data. If you do not see this option, then you’ll have to search for some other topic. 6.

Explain it to me as if you were trying to describe it to a fourth - sixth grade student. A popular indicator is through the a score derived from the Flesch–Kincaid Reading Grade Level. This tool has about 50 years of controversy attached to it, which could easily be an entire chapter of a clearance bin book. Please note that you do not need to report if you applied a readability test to your narrative or how you did it. I just wanted to point out an approach that may be useful in giving you an idea if your narrative is in the ballpark.  Note: Triangulation! Whatever side of the coin you may settle on, this is just a perfect example of why using a single measure is simply a bad idea since you run the risk of an entire study or studies being reliant on a single measure whose validity in this case may be in flux. Barring some well known measures, it is recommended that at least three different indicators are used to assess a construct. This three way assessemment strategy is called triangulation. An well-written and relatively short description of this idea can be accessed through the UNC Charlotte Office of Academic Affairs Regardless, its utility is widespread and so much so that it has been a default measure within Microsoft Word for nearly twenty years.\nRun some reliability checks1 of one to three constructs (not items - you group items together to assess a construct). Then decide which single measure most accurately describes the true internal consistency. Defend your choice with a maximum 280 word (aka 1 Tweet’s worth) or less argument. My advice is to first look at both the codebook and measures. Additionally, choose wisely because you’ll be addressing validity, or rather something called threats to validity next week.

You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\nRStudio.cloud R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free RStudio.cloud service initially, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.\nGo to https://rstudio.cloud/ and create an account. You’ll receive a link to join the shared class workspace separately. If you don’t get this link, let me know and I will invite you.\n RStudio on your computer RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since RStudio.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica.\nHere’s how you install all these things\nInstall R First you need to install R itself (the engine).\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\n Click on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n If you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (as of this writing, it’s R-4.0.0.pkg; as of right now but download the most current version.\n If you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n  Double click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n If you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n   Install RStudio Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\n The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n  Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n Install tidyverse R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n   It’s a goofy name, but CRAN is where most R packages—and R itself—lives.↩︎\n   ","date":1594771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594771200,"objectID":"efb59c0882a965443ffcbafa3cd27ca6","permalink":"/resource/install/","publishdate":"2020-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resource/install/","section":"resource","summary":"RStudio.cloud RStudio on your computer Install R Install RStudio Install tidyverse    You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!","tags":null,"title":"Installing R, RStudio, tidyverse, and tinytex","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Task: Request of Proposal (RFP) Task: Exercise III   Task: Request of Proposal (RFP) A request for proposal (RFP) is a dispersed document that solicits proposals by an agency, company or organization interested in conducting an evaluation. For example, you can go to the American Evaluation Association’s (AEA) Career Center and simply type rfp in the Keyword or Job Title box to take a look at current opportunities and their respective requirements.\nThese types of proposals are often lucrative but highly competitive. Since most RFPs are submitted without any opportunities for follow-ups or clarifications, stakeholder or sponsor will pick the one that has the greatest detail, clearly written, and does not promise too little or even too much!\nThe final project in this course is derived from a much larger study of what employers look for in an evaluator. The requirements of particular task is a carbon copy of findings related to RFPs specifically where documents were analyzed from a systematic sample of two years of RFPs posted on the website listed above and AEA’s Jobs/RFPs site as well.\nWhile you certainly won’t be writing an entire RFP, the criteria will give you practice in addressing an instrumentation and measurement section. Now on to the fun part\nFirst either choose to use an existing instrument or develop one yourself. Now please submit a proposal outlining\n Proposed test items  a description of a current or developing instrument you wish to study including what the entire piece is intended to assess including details related to items or groups of items that may be or are measuring differing constructs. an explanation of (a) how the items were decided upon and (b) how the number of items was determined  Proposed Reliability Assessment  An explanation of how the administration (and/or scoring) of the test will permit you to determine its reliability. Please be specific about which reliability coefficient you are proposing and use the appropriate terminology (e.g., test-retest reliability will be computed by correlating scores obtained from administering the test to a randomly selected group of program participants and re-administering the test to the same group on six months later)  Proposed Validity Assessment  Identification and description of the group for which you want the test to be valid for. Descriptions of at least one approach for computing the content validity, concurrent validity and predictive validity of your test.   The deadline for this RFP is Thursday, August 6 by 11:59PM. The structure and page length is typical for an average sized multi year RFP that a single evaluator would be able conduct ion an individual basis. The proposal should\n be three to five pages double spaced with both front and back used with 12 point Times New Roman font; include both () your name and a working title in the header such that it repeats on every page and (b) page numbers; have a full working or current draft of the proposed instrument attached in an appendix. follow all APA 7th Edition guidelines. have support (e.g. references of previous studies) where an assertion is made. be clearly and concisely written, You simply do not have enough space to get wordy, so read and critique your proposal over and over until you are simply sick of it. If you get to the point where all criteria are met but you are at the “to hell with this and him” stage, then the proposal is probably in a good state to be submitted.   Task: Exercise III This task is pretty simple and is also tied to you final proposal. By Tuesday please send me an email answering one of the following bullets points:\n If you have chosen to create your own instrument and if so, for what purpose? How do you currently envision the data collection tool? Who or what is your intended audience? What is your timeframe? If you have chosen to assess a current instrument and if so, what is it and for what purpose? Have there been any test for validity and/or reliability performed? How widespread is its usage.

What do you think?\n Read Up Now go and read this short synopsis on this and other tests to assess what drives conspirators at Psychology Today. I am personally fond of the BSR.\n Data Files Please download the files below. Note you may have to right click and download each file if your browser renders csv files automatically:\n conspiracyData.csv conspiracyCodebook.csv conspiracyMeasures.csv   Prerequisites Using the exact same process as last week, please open up R and create a new script by going to File \u0026gt; New File \u0026gt; R Script. Save this in an easily accessible folder. Now take the files conspiracyData.csv, conspiracyCodebook.csv and conspiracyMeasures.csv and drop them all in the same folder as your new script. Again unless you are comfortable using directories and file paths, consider keeping both your R script and data sets in the same folder.\nBefore we load the libraries, we’re going to grab a package called psych that is on CRAN. Remember that you only need to do this is if it was not done last week!\nTo install, please run the following command\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;psych\u0026quot;, dependencies = TRUE) or you can simply use the dropdown menu by going to Tools \u0026gt; Install Packages and simply type in psych. Remember to have Install dependencies checkmarked!\nPlease do the same for the packages DT and polycor. Then load the libraries up\nlibrary(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;psych\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;DT\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;polycor\u0026quot;) Now set the working directory to the location of the script by running\nsetwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)) or by selecting Session \u0026gt; Set Working Directory \u0026gt; To Source File Location.\n EFA Suppose you are conducting a survey and you want to know whether the items in the survey have similar patterns of responses, do these items “hang together” to create a construct? This is the underlying principle of a factor analysis, or FA.\nThe basic assumption of an fa is that for a collection of observed variables there are a set of underlying variables called factors (smaller than the observed variables), that can explain the interrelationships among those variables.\nIn this session, we’re going to conduct what is known as a single-factor explanatory factor analysis, or EFA. When you’re using this in the real world, be sure to use a dataset that only contains item responses in a numerical format (e.g. those form a Likert scale question) - other types of data will cause errors and/or incorrect results. In the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale, or GCBS dataset, these are participant responses to 15 items from the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale, which is aptly designed to measure conspiracist beliefs.\n Loading a Local Data Set Like before, Let’s load the data set, codebook, and measures\nconspiracy_data \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;conspiracyData.csv\u0026quot;) ## Parsed with column

So how big is this data set? Well if you love counting, go start or you could simply use the following\ndim(conspiracy_data) ## [1] 2495 15 Now that’s 2495 rows by 15 columns which is a pretty big data set.\n Conducting an EFA Conducting an EFA is relatively straight forward in R and can be done by using the fa() function from the psych package.\nEFA \u0026lt;- fa(conspiracy_data) and then to view the results\nEFA ## Factor Analysis using method = minres ## Call: fa(r = conspiracy_data) ## Standardized loadings (pattern matrix) based upon correlation matrix ## MR1 h2 u2 com ## Q1 0.70 0.49 0.51 1 ## Q2 0.72 0.52 0.48 1 ## Q3 0.64 0.41 0.59 1 ## Q4 0.77 0.59 0.41 1 ## Q5 0.67 0.45 0.55 1 ## Q6 0.75 0.56 0.44 1 ## Q7 0.73 0.54 0.46 1 ## Q8 0.65 0.43 0.57 1 ## Q9 0.70 0.48 0.52 1 ## Q10 0.56 0.32 0.68 1 ## Q11 0.72 0.52 0.48 1 ## Q12 0.79 0.62 0.38 1 ## Q13 0.68 0.46 0.54 1 ## Q14 0.74 0.55 0.45 1 ## Q15 0.57 0.33 0.67 1 ## ## MR1 ## SS loadings 7.27 ## Proportion Var 0.48 ## ## Mean item complexity = 1 ## Test of the hypothesis that 1 factor is sufficient. ## ## The degrees of freedom for the null model are 105 and the objective function was 9.31 with Chi Square of 23173.8 ## The degrees of freedom for the model are 90 and the objective function was 1.93 ## ## The root mean square of the residuals (RMSR) is 0.08 ## The df corrected root mean square of the residuals is 0.09 ## ## The harmonic number of observations is 2495 with the empirical chi square 3398.99 with prob \u0026lt; 0 ## The total number of observations was 2495 with Likelihood Chi Square = 4809.34 with prob \u0026lt; 0 ## ## Tucker Lewis Index of factoring reliability = 0.761 ## RMSEA index = 0.145 and the 90 % confidence intervals are 0.142 0.149 ## BIC = 4105.36 ## Fit based upon off diagonal values = 0.97 ## Measures of factor score adequacy ## MR1 ## Correlation of (regression) scores with factors 0.97 ## Multiple R square of scores with factors 0.94 ## Minimum correlation of possible factor scores 0.87 Note Well that’s a lot of information. While every item on here is important depending on need, we’re going to skip the explanation of everything besides the column MR1 in this course because without some solid background in statistics, the explanation of other item here are difficult to describe. In fact, a majority are not even relevant for our purposes.\n  Viewing and Visualizing Factors Each result using the fa() command actually gives you a list, and each element of the list contains specific information about the analysis, including factor loadings. Factor loadings represent the strength and directionality of the relationship between each item and the underlying factor, and they can range from -1 to 1. We can see this by looking only at the first column\nEFA$loadings ## ## Loadings: ## MR1 ## Q1 0.703 ## Q2 0.719 ## Q3 0.638 ## Q4 0.770 ## Q5 0.672 ## Q6 0.746 ## Q7 0.734 ## Q8 0.654 ## Q9 0.695 ## Q10 0.565 ## Q11 0.719 ## Q12 0.786 ## Q13 0.679 ## Q14 0.743 ## Q15 0.574 ## ## MR1 ## SS loadings 7.267 ## Proportion Var 0.484 You can also create a diagram of loadings. The fa.diagram() command takes the outpit from fa() and creates a diagram, called a path diagram to show the items’ loadings ordered from strongest to weakest. This type of visualization can be a helpful way to represent your results.\nfa.diagram(EFA) Note So why can’t we just use pipes and ggplot here? Well the main problem can be found using this command\nclass(EFA) ## [1] \u0026quot;psych\u0026quot; \u0026quot;fa\u0026quot; Notice that the psych package has its own data type called “psych”. Tidy involves data that is neatly in rows and columns. In any case, we’ll stick to the default format for now.\n  Interpreting Factor Scores The EFA object we’ve created also contains a named list element, scores, which contains factor scores for each person. These factor scores are an indication of how much or how little of the factor each person is thought to possess. Please note that factor scores are not computed for participants with missing data.\nThe EFA object also contains a named list element, scores, which contains factor scores for each person. These factor scores are an indication of how much or how little of the factor each person is thought to possess. Factor scores are not computed for participants with missing data.\nTo see an example, lets first look at the first six rows of the data set\nhead(conspiracy_data) ## # A tibble: 6 x 15 ## Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8 Q9 Q10 Q11 Q12 Q13 ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 5 5 3 5 5 5 5 3 4 5 5 5 3 ## 2 5 5 5 5 5 3 5 5 1 4 4 5 4 ## 3 2 4 1 2 2 2 4 2 2 4 2 4 0 ## 4 5 4 1 2 4 5 4 1 4 5 5 5 1 ## 5 5 4 1 4 4 5 4 3 1 5 5 5 3 ## 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## # … with 2 more variables: Q14 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Q15 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; or we can have a more Excel like version using\ndatatable(head(conspiracy_data))  {\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\"],[5,5,2,5,5,1],[5,5,4,4,4,1],[3,5,1,1,1,1],[5,5,2,2,4,1],[5,5,2,4,4,1],[5,3,2,5,5,1],[5,5,4,4,4,1],[3,5,2,1,3,1],[4,1,2,4,1,1],[5,4,4,5,5,1],[5,4,2,5,5,1],[5,5,4,5,5,1],[3,4,0,1,3,1],[5,4,2,4,5,1],[5,5,4,5,5,1]],\"container\":\"\\n \\n \\n  \\n Q1\\n Q2\\n Q3\\n Q4\\n Q5\\n Q6\\n Q7\\n Q8\\n Q9\\n Q10\\n Q11\\n Q12\\n Q13\\n Q14\\n Q15\\n \\n \\n\",\"options\":{\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]},{\"orderable\":false,\"targets\":0}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c977a82d5f9c9c6bf14f43f56de0b41e","permalink":"/example/04-example/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/example/04-example/","section":"example","summary":"Exploratory Factor Analysis Take This Read Up Data Files Prerequisites EFA Loading a Local Data Set Conducting an EFA Note  Viewing and Visualizing Factors Note  Interpreting Factor Scores      Exploratory Factor Analysis Take This First things first, please go and take the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale.","tags":null,"title":"If You Haven't Tested It, Assume Its Broken","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" This week please complete both the Survey and Measurement Development in R and Correlation and Regression in R courses on Data Camp which includes\n Preparing to analyze survey data\n Exploratory factor analysis \u0026amp; survey development\n Confirmatory factor analysis \u0026amp; construct validation\n Criterion validity \u0026amp; replication\n Visualizing two variables\n Correlation\n Simple linear regression\n Interpreting regression models\n Model Fit\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5a003ab3247913ac8f1034d05b4692ee","permalink":"/lesson/04-lesson/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lesson/04-lesson/","section":"lesson","summary":"This week please complete both the Survey and Measurement Development in R and Correlation and Regression in R courses on Data Camp which includes\n Preparing to analyze survey data","tags":null,"title":"Pirates Cause Global Warming","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Basic Markdown formatting Math Tables Footnotes Front matter Citations Other references   Markdown is a special kind of markup language that lets you format text with simple syntax. You can then use a converter program like pandoc to convert Markdown into whatever format you want: HTML, PDF, Word, PowerPoint, etc. (see the full list of output types here)\nBasic Markdown formatting     Type… …or… …to get    Some text in a paragraph.

There are like a billion little options and features available for math equations—you can find helpful examples of the the most common basic commands here.\nYou can use math in two different ways: inline or in a display block. To use math inline, wrap it in single dollar signs, like $y = mx + b$:\n    Type… …to get    Based on the DAG, the regression model for estimating the effect of education on wages is $\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon$, or $\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon$. Based on the DAG, the regression model for estimating the effect of education on wages is \\(\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon\\), or \\(\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon\\).    To put an equation on its own line in a display block, wrap it in double dollar signs, like this:\nType…\nThe quadratic equation was an important part of high school math: $$ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$ But now we just use computers to solve for $x$. …to get…\n The quadratic equation was an important part of high school math:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\nBut now we just use computers to solve for \\(x\\).\n Because dollar signs are used to indicate math equations, you can’t just use dollar signs like normal if you’re writing about actual dollars. For instance, if you write This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40, Markdown will treat everything that comes between the dollar signs as math, like so: “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\nTo get around that, put a backslash (\\) in front of the dollar signs, so that This book costs \\$5.75 and this other costs \\$40 becomes “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\n Tables There are 4 different ways to hand-create tables in Markdown—I say “hand-create” because it’s normally way easier to use R to generate these things with packages like pander (use pandoc.table()) or knitr (use kable()). The two most common are simple tables and pipe tables. You should look at the full documentation here.\nFor simple tables, type…\n Right Left Center Default ------- ------ ---------- ------- 12 12 12 12 123 123 123 123 1 1 1 1 Table: Caption goes here …to get…\n Caption goes here  Right Left Center Default    12 12 12 12  123 123 123 123  1 1 1 1    For pipe tables, type…\n| Right | Left | Default | Center | |------:|:-----|---------|:------:| | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | | 123 | 123 | 123 | 123 | | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Table: Caption goes here …to get…\n Caption goes here  Right Left Default Center    12 12 12 12  123 123 123 123  1 1 1 1     Footnotes There are two different ways to add footnotes (see here for complete documentation): regular and inline.\nRegular notes need (1) an identifier and (2) the actual note. The identifier can be whatever you want. Some people like to use numbers like [^1], but if you ever rearrange paragraphs or add notes before #1, the numbering will be wrong (in your Markdown file, not in the output; everything will be correct in the output). Because of that, I prefer to use some sort of text label:\nType…\nHere is a footnote reference[^1] and here is another [^note-on-dags]. [^1]: This is a note. [^note-on-dags]: DAGs are neat. And here\u0026#39;s more of the document. …to get…\n Here is a footnote reference1 and here is another.2\nAnd here’s more of the document.\n  This is a note.↩︎   DAGs are neat.↩︎     You can also use inline footnotes with ^[Text of the note goes here], which are often easier because you don’t need to worry about identifiers:\nType…\nCausal inference is neat.^[But it can be hard too!] …to get…\n Causal inference is neat.1\n  But it can be hard too!↩︎      Front matter You can include a special section at the top of a Markdown document that contains metadata (or data about your document) like the title, date, author, etc. This section uses a special simple syntax named YAML (or “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”) that follows this basic outline: setting: value for setting. Here’s an example YAML metadata section. Note that it must start and end with three dashes (---).\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; --- You can put the values inside quotes (like the date and name in the example above), or you can leave them outside of quotes (like the title in the example above). I typically use quotes just to be safe—if the value you’re using has a colon (:) in it, it’ll confuse Markdown since it’ll be something like title: My cool title: a subtitle, which has two colons. It’s better to do this:\n--- title: \u0026quot;My cool title: a subtitle\u0026quot; --- If you want to use quotes inside one of the values (e.g. your document is An evaluation of \"scare quotes\"), you can use single quotes instead:\n--- title: \u0026#39;An evaluation of \u0026quot;scare quotes\u0026quot;\u0026#39; ---  Citations One of the most powerful features of Markdown + pandoc is the ability to automatically cite things and generate bibliographies. to use citations, you need to create a BibTeX file (ends in .bib) that contains a database of the things you want to cite. You can do this with bibliography managers designed to work with BibTeX directly (like BibDesk on macOS), or you can use Zotero (macOS and Windows) to export a .bib file. You can download an example .bib file of all the readings from this class here.\nComplete details for using citations can be found here. In brief, you need to do three things:\nAdd a bibliography: entry to the YAML metadata:\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; bibliography: name_of_file.bib --- Choose a citation style based on a CSL file. The default is Chicago author-date, but you can choose from 2,000+ at this repository. Download the CSL file, put it in your project folder, and add an entry to the YAML metadata (or provide a URL to the online version):\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; bibliography: name_of_file.bib csl: \u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa.csl\u0026quot; --- Some of the most common CSLs are:\n Chicago author-date Chicago note-bibliography Chicago full note-bibliography (no shortened notes or ibids){target=\"_blank\"} APA 7th edition MLA 8th edition  Cite things in your document. Check the documentation for full details of how to do this. Essentially, you use @citationkey inside square brackets ([]):\n    Type… …to get…    Causal inference is neat [@Rohrer:2018; @AngristPischke:2015].

Make sure you keep an accurate record of what data set was used and where you got it from.\nWhere can you find data you ask? Oh you didn’t. Well its too late now so here are some suggestions. These are given in alphabetical order without any preferential ranking:\n AWS public datasets - This stands for Amazon Web Service and yes its that Amazon. Believe it or not, Amazon is one of the largest providers of APIs (acronym for application programming interface which is a fancy way to say a service where computer programs can talk to each other), data analytics (fancy of way of saying that a computer is being used for stats), data processing (fancy way of say how efficient data can be analyzed, rearranged, whatever), and storage cloud computing (fancy way of saying securing, sharing and storing data and sharing it). To this end, a lot and I mean a lot of data sets are publicly available.\n Baidu Research - Baidu provides a wide range of data sets at no cost for research and personal uses. They provide data from the various business units like automated car testing, medical, video highlight. While it is unlikely you’ll locate a survey response set, this is a good thing to note.\n data.gov - In the United States, all publicly funded data sets are available barring those that may pose a security threat (but you can even get those eventually using the Freedom of Information Act). Other bodies freely share their data as well such as the UK, the EU, and India. There are plenty of other organizations that share their data too. For example, whatever your opinion is on the World Bankor even if you don’t have one, even they shares their data since it is publicly funded as well!\n data.world - One of the best publicly available repos out there. Some of the sets even come with full R scripts! Other software scripts like Excel, Python, SPSS, SAS, etc are available as well. This is strictly user driven so availability is contingent on who shares what and how.\n Github - Not only are public data sets plentiful on Github, but people have also taken the time to compile a list for the rest of us. Here are a few popular ones (I promise not every repo is named awesome on Github):\n Awesome Public Datasets Awesome Data   Google Dataset Search - Much like nearly every other Google service (e.g. Google Scholar), Goggle Datasets doesn’t actually house anything, rather it is a means for you to get to data, aka a portal what a fantastic name), without having to search all over the web. It is fairly new and their database grows every second - actually its faster than that but as humans we have trouble compartmentalizing any unit of time smaller than a second. Now if you’ve heard the term indexing, that is not this. The best analogy I can think of is creating a grocery shopping list as needed through the week (aka adding to the data base) and then reordering and grouping food items that are closest in proximity to each other so that you can get out of the store as quick and efficiently as possible1.\n Kaggle - Described as an AirBnB for data scientists, this site has a ton of public and sometimes private data that has been cleared for public consumption. More than that, it is an absolute playpen if you like exploring data. If you go headfirst into a data set and cannot and I mean cannot cognitively picture an end goal or what the data will tell you until something is done with it, this is the place for you!\n   What to Turn in After you have located a data set, do the data scientist thing and please follow these steps:\nOpen up the codebook and locate two columns:   one that has a unique identifier one f your choice that is preferably not filled with demographical information  Use the same steps outlined in the example piece to conduct your own factor analysis.\n Answer the following questions on a word document. As usual, please put your name in the upper left hand corner.\n  What is the official name of the data set you chose? What repository did you get it from (e.g. data.world, Kaggle, etc)? If you did not get it from a place where data is housed, please copy and paste the web address. Please do not copy and paste any additional nonsense that say search engines put on a web address. For example, if you’ve ever copied and pasted a website after using Google, you may notice that the address is obnoxiously long. I don’t want that. If you are having trouble, contact me and I’ll help you through it. How did you determine the number of factors? What are the factors likely representative of? hint: look at the loadings Describe the results into a single paragraph narrative. Try to be specific and concise. There is a very narrow way to interpret the results of a factor analysis.  Submit your script, a copy of the data set and responses on eCampus.  :::\n   Try doing this if you don’t like shopping!↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ae6bdb9cc7518a780be99848063a951b","permalink":"/assignment/05-exercise/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/05-exercise/","section":"assignment","summary":"Task: Exercise IV Locating Data What to Turn in    Note: The title for this week is a terrible pun but I lost a bet so her we are.","tags":null,"title":"Can We Be Factors Forever?","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ac11eb4b300887ac6e4fc5c1906670ba","permalink":"/example/05-example/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/example/05-example/","section":"example","summary":"   ","tags":null,"title":"Nerds!","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" While we have head the same saying that correlation \\(\\nRightarrow\\) causation, it CAN imply it (with enough evidence!)

Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for “r scatterplot”, but if it does struggle, try searching for “rstats” instead (e.g. “rstats scatterplot”). Also, since most of your R work in this class will deal with the tidyverse family of packages, it’s often easier to just search for that instead of the letter “R” (e.g. “tidy pivoting”).\nIf you use Twitter, post R-related questions and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful. Also check out StackOverflow (a Q\u0026amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)).\nThese resources are also really really helpful:\n CSE 631: Principles \u0026amp; Practice of Data Visualization: Yet another introductory course for R and ggplot2 by Dr. Alison Presmanes Hill at RStudio.

You can do everything you can with regular Markdown, but you can incorporate graphs, tables, and other R output directly in your document. You can create HTML, PDF, and Word documents, PowerPoint and HTML presentations, websites, books, and even interactive dashboards with R Markdown. This whole course website is created with R Markdown (and a package named blogdown).\nThe documentation for R Markdown is extremely comprehensive, and their tutorials and cheatsheets are excellent—rely on those.\nHere are the most important things you’ll need to know about R Markdown in this class:\nKey terms  Document: A Markdown file where you type stuff\n Chunk: A piece of R code that is included in your document. It looks like this:\n```{r} # Code goes here ``` There must be an empty line before and after the chunk. The final three backticks must be the only thing on the line—if you add more text, or if you forget to add the backticks, or accidentally delete the backticks, your document will not knit correctly.\n Knit: When you “knit” a document, R runs each of the chunks sequentially and converts the output of each chunk into Markdown. R then runs the knitted document through pandoc to convert it to HTML or PDF or Word (or whatever output you’ve selected).\nYou can knit by clicking on the “Knit” button at the top of the editor window, or by pressing ⌘⇧K on macOS or control + shift + K on Windows.\n   Add chunks There are three ways to insert chunks:\n Press ⌘⌥I on macOS or control + alt + I on Windows\n Click on the “Insert” button at the top of the editor window\n Manually type all the backticks and curly braces (don’t do this)\n   Chunk names You can add names to chunks to make it easier to navigate your document. If you click on the little dropdown menu at the bottom of your editor in RStudio, you can see a table of contents that shows all the headings and chunks. If you name chunks, they’ll appear in the list. If you don’t include a name, the chunk will still show up, but you won’t know what it does.\nTo add a name, include it immediately after the {r in the first line of the chunk. Names cannot contain spaces, but they can contain underscores and dashes. All chunk names in your document must be unique.\n```{r name-of-this-chunk} # Code goes here ```  Chunk options There are a bunch of different options you can set for each chunk. You can see a complete list in the RMarkdown Reference Guide or at knitr’s website.\nOptions go inside the {r} section of the chunk:\n```{r name-of-this-chunk, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE} # Code goes here ``` The most common chunk options are these:\n fig.width=5 and fig.height=3 (or whatever number you want): Set the dimensions for figures echo=FALSE: The code is not shown in the final document, but the results are message=FALSE: Any messages that R generates (like all the notes that appear after you load a package) are omitted warning=FALSE: Any warnings that R generates are omitted include=FALSE: The chunk still runs, but the code and results are not included in the final document  You can also set chunk options by clicking on the little gear icon in the top right corner of any chunk:\n Inline chunks You can also include R output directly in your text, which is really helpful if you want to report numbers from your analysis. To do this, use `r r_code_here`.\nIt’s generally easiest to calculate numbers in a regular chunk beforehand and then use an inline chunk to display the value in your text. For instance, this document…\n```{r find-avg-mpg, echo=FALSE} avg_mpg \u0026lt;- mean(mtcars$mpg) ``` The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was `r round(avg_mpg, 1)` miles per gallon. … would knit into this:\n The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was 20.1 miles per gallon.\n  Output formats You can specify what kind of document you create when you knit in the YAML front matter.\ntitle: \u0026quot;My document\u0026quot; output: html_document: default pdf_document: default word_document: default You can also click on the down arrow on the “Knit” button to choose the output and generate the appropriate YAML. If you click on the gear icon next to the “Knit” button and choose “Output options”, you change settings for each specific output type, like default figure dimensions or whether or not a table of contents is included.\nThe first output type listed under output: will be what is generated when you click on the “Knit” button or press the keyboard shortcut (⌘⇧K on macOS; control + shift + K on Windows). If you choose a different output with the “Knit” button menu, that output will be moved to the top of the output section.\nThe indentation of the YAML section matters, especially when you have settings nested under each output type. Here’s what a typical output section might look like:\n--- title: \u0026quot;My document\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;My name\u0026quot; date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; output: html_document: toc: yes fig_caption: yes fig_height: 8 fig_width: 10 pdf_document: latex_engine: xelatex # More modern PDF typesetting engine toc: yes word_document: toc: yes fig_caption: yes fig_height: 4 fig_width: 5 ---  ","date":1594771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594771200,"objectID":"00c0b36df90b91640842af65d1311657","permalink":"/resource/rmarkdown/","publishdate":"2020-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resource/rmarkdown/","section":"resource","summary":"Key terms Add chunks Chunk names Chunk options Inline chunks Output formats   R Markdown is regular Markdown with R code and output sprinkled in.

All of these things will do exactly the same thing:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) filter ( mpg,cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot; ) But you’ll notice that only a few of those iterations (the first three) are easily readable.\nTo help improve readability and make it easier to share code with others, there’s an unofficial style guide for writing R code. It’s fairly short and just has lots of examples of good and bad ways of writing code (naming variables, dealing with long lines, using proper indentation levels, etc.)—you should glance through it some time.\nRStudio has a built-in way of cleaning up your code. Select some code, press ctrl + i (on Windows) or ⌘ + i (on macOS), and R will reformat the code for you. It’s not always perfect, but it’s really helpful for getting indentation right without having to manually hit space a billion times.\n Main style things to pay attention to for this class  Important note: I won’t ever grade you on any of this! If you submit something like filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\"compact\"), I might recommend adding spaces, but it won’t affect your grade or points or anything.\n Spacing  See the “Spacing” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Put spaces after commas (like in regular English):\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg , cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg ,cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg,cty \u0026gt; 10) Put spaces around operators like +, -, \u0026gt;, =, etc.:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt;10) filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt;10) Don’t put spaces around parentheses that are parts of functions:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter (mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter ( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10 )  Long lines  See the “Long lines” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n It’s generally good practice to not have really long lines of code. A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (ew), in RStudio go to “Tools” \u0026gt; “Global Options” \u0026gt; “Code” \u0026gt; “Display” and check the box for “Show margin”. You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this—that’s fine. It’s just good practice to avoid going too far past it.\nYou can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Bad filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;)) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;))  Pipes (%\u0026gt;%) and ggplot layers (+) Put each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the + at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() Put each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the %\u0026gt;% at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  Comments  See the “Comments” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Comments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: #\n# Good #Bad #Bad If the comment is really short (and won’t cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code, separated by at least two spaces (it works with one space, but using a couple can enhance readability):\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group You can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group If the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines.

When you unzip a zipped file, your operating system extracts all the files that are contained inside into a new folder on your computer.\nUnzipping files on macOS is trivial, but unzipping files on Windows can mess you up if you don’t pay careful attention. Here’s a helpful guide to unzipping files on both macOS and Windows.\nUnzipping files on macOS Double click on the downloaded .zip file. macOS will automatically create a new folder with the same name as the .zip file, and all the file’s contents will be inside. Double click on the RStudio Project file (.Rproj) to get started.\n Unzipping files on Windows tl;dr: Right click on the .zip file, select “Extract All…”, and work with the resulting unzipped folder.\nUnlike macOS, Windows does not automatically unzip things for you. If you double click on the .zip file, Windows will show you what’s inside, but it will do so without actually extracting anything. This can be is incredibly confusing! Here’s what it looks like—the only clues that this folder is really a .zip file are that there’s a “Compressed Folder Tools” tab at the top, and there’s a “Ratio” column that shows how much each file is compressed.\nIt is very tempting to try to open files from this view. However, if you do, things will break and you won’t be able to correctly work with any of the files in the zipped folder. If you open the R Project file, for instance, RStudio will point to a bizarre working directory buried deep in some temporary folder:\nYou most likely won’t be able to open any data files or save anything, which will be frustrating.\nInstead, you need to right click on the .zip file and select “Extract All…”:\nThen choose where you want to unzip all the files and click on “Extract”\nYou should then finally have a real folder with all the contents of the zipped file.

Online  Slack   Contacting me Slack is the best way to get in contact with me. Response times are typically much quicker than the standard 24-48 hours given to emails. Please remember that life is somewhat chaotic at this time!\n  Course objectives You can measure anything (well mostly) Without a basic understanding of measures, you may not be sitting here today! Measurement is a principle trait and whether it is hard wired, learned, or some combination of both, its absence makes quantitative data impossible to classify. But even in cases where measures are available, how can we know if they are consistent and accurate? Without these checks, instruments such as surveys could never be constructed, much less yield results that could be generalized.\nWhen assessing existing programs, having an ability to test a hypothesis is key in understanding its goals. While evaluation tells us whether a program is producing results or having an effect/impact, (performance) measurement tells us what a program did and how well it did it. In particular, the latter is a necessity and involves collecting and reporting data that can be used to compartmentalize the way a program is being implemented.\nSpecifically, you should be able to:\n assess the credibility and ethics of measurement practices be confident in determining valid and reliable measures have the ability to interpret and report psychometric properties of tests view measurement as a typical step in the evaluative process  By the end of this course, you will hopefully become (1) literate in the connection between data and measurement principles, and (2) a skeptic of every research question or purpose that you come across.\nAdditionally, this class will expose you to R—one of the most popular and in-demand statistical languages. Armed with the foundation of R skills you’ll learn in this class, you’ll know enough to be able to find how to analyze and visualize many outputs based on measures.\n FAQ Is the course content difficult? You’ve probably heard an answer like this before: At times some of the material can be dense. Well that isn’t much of a response. Difficulty is not the issue here since as humans with differing educational background, we will have strengths in some areas more than others. Instead the question is can you identify areas that need strengthened and communicate them? If you can, then you have a good shot at succeeding in this class.\n Is R difficult? Learning R can be especially challenging at first—it’s akin to learning a new language like Spanish or even mathematics. Even experienced R users get frustrated…and so much so that some of us have swear jars. However as silly as it sounds one of the best feelings is to overcome a roadblock. With that said, if you find yourself getting irritated, try the following: take a break, go let some frustration out, sleep, discuss with a peer, etc. If you are at your limit, take a few breaths and contact me!\n What if I find a mistake? Tell me! I strive to be error free but like everyone else, make silly mistakes. This includes grammar and spelling errors as well!\n  Course materials There are two texts and three software packages necessary for this course. With that said, you will receive some supplementary materials in the course as well.\nTexts We’ll rely on the texts below:\n McDavid, J. C., Huse, I., \u0026amp; Hawthorn, L. R. L. (2019). Program evaluation and performance measurement an introduction to practice (3rd ed.). SAGE.\n American Psychological Association. (2020). Publication manual of the American Psychological Association (7th ed.).\n Albano, T. (2020). Introduction to Educational and Psychological Measurement Using R. https://thetaminusb.com/intro-measurement-r/.\n  There will occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the content page for that session.\nSubscribing to the R Weekly newsletter provides many helpful tutorials about how to do R. This certainly is not a requirement.\n Software R and RStudio You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language R. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard — R handles all the calculations produces the actual statistics and graphical output, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code. Please note that\nyou do not need to have any programming experience to use R\n R is free, but it can sometimes be a task to install and configure. To make life easier, you can opt to use the free RStudio.cloud service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This is recommended for those of you who do not want to install programs right now but please note that you will most likely have to in the near future.\nThe service is convenient, but please keep in mind that it can be slow and is not designed to handle large data sets or more complicated analysis and graphics. You also cannot customize much with RStudio.cloud. Over the course of the term, you’ll want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud.\nYou can find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.\n  Note: Online help Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and its always the tiny errors in your coding can result in tons of headache. People working in any syntax based software package at any level experience this!\nBut there are multiple resources online to help.\n First you will have access to Data Camp which allows you to relieve professional training that otherwise costs a lot of money. Is it perfect and flashy? Nope but it is interactive and if you pay attention, then R’s initial steep learning curve won’t feel like an uphill battle.\n Second two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q\u0026amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)). I freely admit that StackOverflow has saved me multiple hours of frustration. Just note if you have a syntax or process issue, both sites require you to produce a minimally reproducible example.\n Third using Twitter you can post R-related questions and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.\n Fourth searching for help with R on Google (or another indexed search site) can sometimes be tricky because the program name is,for a lack of a better explanation, a single letter.\n Fifth we have a class chatroom which may be accessed via Slack where you can poise a question. I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond quickly. (This is a rare Slack work space where I readily keep notifications on!) Ask questions about the readings, exercises, and mini projects. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too.\n Sixth and lastly you can send items by Slack or email me with questions about content, R or whatever (after giving a graduate student effort of course). Please include the subject header EDP 613 “the title of your email” where the title of your email is given without the quotes. Know that I will not just give you the answer, but am happy to push you in the right direction. If you do email me, please include the following:\n A brief description of the problem and what you have done thus far including the line number of the issue (if applicable). A copy of your data set (if applicable). A copy of your script or Rmarkdown document with comments throughout so I know what you’ve tried historically leading up to the issue.   I have a mail filter that will automatically bring your email to a top priority status.1\nYou should absolutely expect to struggle at times, but there is no better and more satisfying feeling than figuring things out for yourself! In the long run, you’re more likely to remember things you’ve figured out rather than those you’ve been shown or told.\n  Assignments and grades You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page.\n   Assignment Points Percent    Reflections (6 × 20) 120 24%  Exercises (6 × 20) 120 24%  Situation 1 60 12%  Situation 2 60 12%  Final project 140 28%  Total 500 —     \n   Grade Range    A 90–100%  B 80%-89%  C 70–79%  D 60–69%  F \u0026lt; 60%     Your hours Please watch this video:\n Your hours (formerly known as office hours) are set times dedicated to you the student!2). This means that I will be in my office at home waiting for you to come by talk to me remotely with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.\nBecause of the pandemic, we cannot meet in person. I can meet you online via Zoom. You can request a meeting through either e-mail or Slack.\n Class conduct and expectations Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up or stole from other professors:\n Late work: Barring the final project, past due deliverables will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via eCampus. There are no exceptions to this policy. Please note that I will not accept coursework by email or any other means.\n Participation: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate in class. Engagement is mostly defined by you—if that means commenting and answering questions, neat; if it means sitting quietly and being focused, also neat; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off, not so neat.\n Rubrics: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level, I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:\nWhen writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), there is (typically) no such document as a rubric. If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up). Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor. Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!   Technology use: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. You’re all adults…well I am most of the time.\n   Learning and knowledge during a pandemic Ok I’m going to get a bit philosophical but it’s not too deep and there’s a point so please bear with me. Let’s first start with something at the top of a syllabus that many people skip - the course objectives. Well now that you’re no doubt excited excited, read the rest this rant to figure out if you have learned something or you actually know it.\nWhen course objectives are written explicitly and clearly, they provide the information you need to figure out what a student should be able to do by the end of a given term. In fact, professors often test your proficiency in an area through multiple assessments such as exams, papers, presentations, etc where you are essentially asked to show us what you have learned. But learning isn’t knowledge.\nTo save you from a long philosophical narrative on epistemology, in a nutshell we humans are not really good at evaluating a person’s knowledge within a short timeframe…oh say like a semester. With that said you probably spend a lot of time with you, so you should be pretty good at knowing if you know something but you may not know how to figure out what you actually know. If your head doesn’t hurt and you really want a good indicator that something you learned has become knowledge, ask this simple question that is often difficult to answer:\nCan I explain whatever using basic everyday language so that a fourth grader can understand it?\n So the fourth grader isn’t that important as much as self assessing if you can explain a concept to someone who lacks any basic understanding using every day language. This is basically what good teachers can do, in that they are able to take a high level concept that may be inaccessible to most of us and bring it down to a level we can all generally understand.\nMany, if not all of you will fall somewhere in the spectrum of somewhat to mostly. If you’re sitting on the absolute Yes end, then consider a career in survey research because it can be very fulfilling and lucrative. But if you find yourself on the absolute No end, then please contact me and let’s try to get you where you need to be. There are a lot of moving parts in this course and not being able to translate some of what you’ve learned into knowledge can have a cascading effect. And by now in your life, you should have a pretty good idea when anyone uses the term cascading, its rarely a good thing.\nOn top of what’s noted above and I’m not sure how to articulate this any better - life just sucks right now in general! You may know people who have lost their jobs, tested positive for COVID-19, been hospitalized, or have even passed away. Additionally your personal responsibilities have probably shifted and for whatever reason or combination thereof, you’re probably more stressed than usual. So here is my promise to you:\nIf you keep an open line, show initiative, and let me know ahead of time if something is going not according to plan3, I will do everything I can to help you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class!\n So what does that mean? Well I will absolutely make whatever reasonable and feasible accommodations I can to help you learn the course material, finish your tasks, and to understand what areas you may need to concentrate on. Under these current pandemic conditions, I try to stay flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations. Furthermore, if you feel like you are behind or not understanding everything, please please please do not stay silent! As I said earlier, drop me a line!\nI selfishly want you to learn lots of things from this class (design! analysis! R! creating visualizations!, no parallel lines exist in 3D - ok maybe not that last one but its true and really easy to show. If you want to know, ask!). There is a lot to do in this course and some of the content can be frustrating, so make sure to take breaks, go relax, even curse my name if you have to - do whatever you need to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.\n  Course policies Its pretty simple: Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat. Stay in touch. Be a good human.\n We will also follow WVU’s Code of Conduct.\nThis syllabus reflects a plan for the term but things change and plans change. so deviations may become necessary as we move along during the term. Note that I reserve the right to alter or amend this syllabus and will send notifications if course tasks are affected.\n COVID-19 Statement WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.\nIn a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe the social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines set by the University at all times. While in class, students will sit in assigned seats when applicable and wear the required PPE. Should a student forget to bring the required PPE, PPE will be available in the building for students to acquire. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.\nIf a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes.\nPsychological and Psychiatric Services Life at WVU can be complicated and challenging, especially during a pandemic! You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. Psychological and Psychiatric Services provides free, confidential support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The office is staffed by professional counselors and psychiatrists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students. Please do not hesitate to contact them for assistance—getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n CARE Team If you or anyone you know may be at-risk such as those listed here, please make a CARE referral. You may do so directly at the main WVU CARE TEAM site.\n Lauren’s Promise I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\n Lauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or the Campus Police at 304-293-3136.\nIf you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call/text a private Title IX On-Call Line 304-906-9930.\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at West Virginia University. WVU has instituted procedures to respond to violations of these laws and standards, programs aimed at the prevention of such conduct, and intervention on behalf of the victims.\n Academic Integrity The integrity of the classes offered by any academic institution solidifies the foundation of its mission and cannot be sacrificed to expediency, ignorance, or blatant fraud. Therefore, I will enforce rigorous standards of academic integrity in all aspects and assignments of this course. For the detailed policy of West Virginia University regarding the definitions of acts considered to fall under academic dishonesty and possible ensuing sanctions, please see the West Virginia University Academic Catalog at http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. Should you have any questions about possibly improper research citations or references, or any other activity that may be interpreted as an attempt at academic dishonesty, please see me before the assignment is due to discuss the matter.\n Inclusivity Statement The West Virginia University community is committed to creating and fostering a positive learning and working environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and inclusion.\nIf you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of accommodation in order to participate in this class, please advise me and make appropriate arrangements with the Office of Accessibility Services (304-293-6700).\nFor more information on West Virginia University’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, please see http://diversity.wvu.edu.\n Incomplete Grades Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term. If the instructor agrees, the instructor and the student must negotiate the conditions under which the grade of I will be changed to a letter grade and sign a contract. The date to submit the incomplete work should not be set beyond the last day of class of the following semester. If the student does not complete the terms of contract, then the instructor should submit a grade of F. All incomplete contracts must be filed with the department and Dean’s Office. See the policy at [Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term. If the instructor agrees, the instructor and the student must negotiate the conditions under which the grade of I will be changed to a letter grade and sign a contract.

See the policy at http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/enrollmentandregistration/#gradestext.\n Sale of Course Materials All course materials, including lectures, class notes, quizzes, exams, handouts, presentations, and other materials provided to students for this course are protected under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Please review the sharing and editing restrictions prior to distributing or amending any material on this site. As such, the unauthorized purchase or sale of these materials may result in disciplinary sanctions under the Campus Student Code. Basically you can share what you like but don’t try to make a buck.\n Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI) Effective teaching is a primary mission of West Virginia University. Student evaluation of instruction provides the university and the instructor with feedback about your experiences in the course for review and course improvement. Your participation in the evaluation of course instruction is both strongly encouraged and highly valued. Results are strictly confidential, anonymous, and not available to the instructor until after final grades are released by Admissions and Records. Information about how you can complete this evaluation will be provided later.\n University Attendance Policy At West Virginia University, class attendance contributes significantly to academic success. Students who attend classes regularly tend to earn higher grades and have higher passing rates in courses. Excessive absences may jeopardize students’ grades or even their ability to continue in their courses. There is a strong correlation between regular class attendance and academic success.\n Course Netiquette The basic premise is that the etiquette expected of students in the online environment is the same as that expected in a classroom. Common courtesy is the guiding rule of Internet communications. Be prepared to communicate effectively when taking an online course. Following these simple netiquette rules in your online class or education environment will ensure your success:\n Include a professional salutation. In this case, “Hello Dr. Roy” or “Dear Dr. Roy” is appropriate. Include a proper ending such as “Thank you” or “With regards.” Then type in your full name. Never type in ALL CAPS, because it reads as if you ARE SHOUTING AT PEOPLE. Act as professionally, via your writing, as you would in a face to face classroom. Refrain from inappropriate language and derogatory or personal attacks. Do not dominate any discussion. Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion. Disagree with ideas but avoid challenges that may be interpreted as a personal attack. Check that you are replying to the specific person you intend, and not to the entire class. Never give your password to another person. Respect the virtual classroom. Never forward in-class communications or posts by others outside of this virtual space. Never spam your classmates. If you quote someone’s previous post, only quote enough to make your point.  Be aware of the University’s Academic Integrity and Dishonesty Policy http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. You can review the rules, regulations, and procedures concerning student conduct and discipline for the main campus of West Virginia University, at http://campuslife.wvu.edu/r/download/1802350.\n Response Time I generally respond to Slack queries in the same day while responses to emails and discussion posts are within 48 hours, except during holidays. Often, I will reply much more quickly but you should not count on a immediate. Please plan accordingly so that you don’t miss deadlines! I generally return assignments within one to two weeks after a final submission date.\n Technical Requirements Students need to have access to a computer for word processing, e-mail and access to eCampus. Access to the Internet is necessary for completion of this course. Run the Browser Check. This tool will check that you are using a supported Internet browser and have a valid Java version installed. The required technical skills to participate in this course are:\nNavigate the web Use email with attachments Create and submit files in commonly used word processing program formats Copy and paste Download and install software Consult software tutorials and other online sources as a method of learning software features Use syntax when necessary  Notice that programming is not on here!\n Technical Support Technical support regarding your use of eCampus is available by contacting 304-293-4444 (telephone), 1-877-327-9260 (toll free number), itshelp@mail.wvu.edu (email), and/or http://it.wvu.edu (website).\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n   In this new normal, I receive an overwhelming number of emails per day and may miss yours if the header is not formatted properly.↩︎\n There is some misunderstanding about what office hours actually are! For some reason that is not clear, particular graduate students have noted in my course evaluations that they believe these to be the times I should not be disturbed.
