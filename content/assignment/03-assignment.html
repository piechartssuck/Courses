<h3>Planning: Selecting a Population</h3>
<p>In this class, you will plan, create, pilot, administer, and analyze a survey from start to finish. In this first step, consider an accessible population of people you would like to survey. While you’re not stuck with your choice, think hard about this because. Moving on to any stage beyond planning can mean hours if not days or weeks of work wasted.</p>
