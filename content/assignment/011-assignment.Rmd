### Plan of Analysis
In this class, you will plan, design, pilot, distribute, **analyze** and report on a survey from start to finish. The material below is highly recommended, especially for those who do not have a great deal of experience administering surveys as a primary investigator (PI).

#### Process
1. Take this week to think and finalize a plan for analysis. Remember that different types if questions require different types of analyses If you would like to discuss, simply send a request over Slack or email and I will be happy to meet.
2. Keep a detailed record of the types of analyses. These will be important in your report and to some degree, your presentation as well.

*Please note you do not have to turn this in as a separate task.*
