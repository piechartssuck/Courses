## Evaluation Prospectus Prospects
If you have already formed a team or have done so early enough, you may want to consider discussing possible programs to reach out to or that you are involved with. For example, many non profits have difficulties procuring evaluations, especially if they rely on federal or state grants for some portion of their funding. Schools that have implemented programs outside of their typical curriculum are also a great avenues to take, though you typically have have an affiliation. If you would simply like to throw some ideas around, send me a message on [`#let-talk-about-an-evaluation`](https://2021edp617.slack.com/archives/C01LSK1C6SW){target="_blank"}.
