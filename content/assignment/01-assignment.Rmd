## Exercise

- Most important task of the week - well to me at least. Please 
1. Go to the course [Slack](2020edp619.slack.com){target="_blank"} account 2. Register if you have to. You do not have to use your WVU account but its not a bad idea.
3. Head to to the channel #introduce-yourself and well introduce yourself by tell everyone about yourself, what you hope to achieve out of this course, and something about you that really defines who you are. For example:
<br>
*I teach data visualization BUT I am also about 40% colorblind!* 
<br>
4. (optional) Provide a picture if you are willing. I am a very visual person as are many other people so pictures help a great deal. However, you are not mandated to do so!

- This week you have nothing to turn in but there is still something to do! First think about what constitutes a bad survey question like the one below

<center>
![Terrible Item](/img/examples/Week1.png)
</center>

1. Now download the [Bad Questions](/files/Bad_Questions.docx){target="_blank"} document. 
2. Go through each item and just jot down what you think is off, misleading, etc. I will tell you each item has at lead one error that can lead to confusing from respondents - aka **response errors**.

I will post solutions of what may be the most egregious errors next week.
