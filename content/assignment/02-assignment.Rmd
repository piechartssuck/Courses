## Evaluation Teams
It is time to start thinking about your evaluation team. These are groups of 3-4 people that will work with each other through the entire real world evaluations that will be conducted in the course. Go to the [`#talk-about-logistics`](https://2021edp617.slack.com/archives/C01KV9GPGRZ){target="_blank"} discussion board and post timeslots you might be available to engage in group chat room discussions on a weekly basis. Read through othersâ€™ postings to find people who you could potentially be in a group with. You will have until the end of Week 3 to finalize your group membership. Instructions for finalizing the team will be posted next week!
