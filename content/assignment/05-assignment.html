<h3>Construction: Designing a Survey Draft</h3>
<p>In this class, you will plan, <strong>create</strong>, pilot, administer, and analyze a survey from start to finish. After receiving a thumbs up from your planning task, in this second step you will create a draft survey that will eventually be administered in one form or another to your approved population.</p>
<div id="submit" class="section level4">
<h4>Submit</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A one paragraph narrative explaining the purpose of your survey including any overarching questions you need or want to answer.</li>
<li>A <em>draft</em> form of your survey submitted in <a href="https://wvu.qualtrics.com/" target="_blank">Qualtrics</a> two Sundays from now. In this case a <em>draft</em> does not simply mean throwing questions together and hoping for the best. You are responsible for ensuring that items are constructed properly as noted in last weekâ€™s <a href="/lesson/04-lesson/#survey-design-1">PowerPoint</a> and in Chapters 4-6 of the text. Your earned score will reflect this.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note that You have two weeks to complete this task.</strong>
