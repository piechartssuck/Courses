<h2>Task: Exercise II</h2>
<p>Please use this roadmap to download a data set of your choice to analyze:
1. Go to the data repository <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/" target="_blank">ICPSR</a> out of the University of Michigan.
2. Sign up for an account <strong>with your university email address</strong> because you will be able to download available data sets given that WVU is a member institution.
3. After logging in fully, go to the <code>FIND DATA</code> tab and then select <code>FIND DATA</code> in the drop down (that’s not confusing at all).
4. Search for a data set that both interests you and is measurable by typing in a topic. Ideally you want to find a data set that have responses that are quantified, have a scale, and that scale is consistent across multiple items.
5. After the search has completed, you may notice there are filters on the left hand side. Scroll down to <code>Data Availibility</code> and select <code>Public Data</code>. If you do not see this option, then you’ll have to search for some other topic.
6. You can also enable other filters like <code>Data Format</code> where you can find both <code>Delimited</code> (aka <code>csv</code> files) and <code>R</code> files too!</p>
<p>Your task is three fold:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>describe the data in layman’s terms but not informally. Explain it to me as if you were trying to describe it to a fourth - sixth grade student. A popular indicator is through the a score derived from the <a href="https://readable.com/" target="_blank">Flesch–Kincaid Reading Grade Level</a>. This tool has about 50 years of controversy attached to it, which could easily be an entire chapter of a clearance bin book. Please note that you do not need to report if you applied a readability test to your narrative or how you did it. I just wanted to point out an approach that may be useful in giving you an idea if your narrative is in the ballpark.</li>

<h3>Note: Triangulation!</h3>
<p>Whatever side of the coin you may settle on, this is just a perfect example of why using a single measure is simply a bad idea since you run the risk of an entire study or studies being reliant on a single measure whose validity in this case may be in flux. Barring some well known measures, it is recommended that at least three different indicators are used to assess a construct. This three way assessemment strategy is called <em>triangulation</em>. An well-written and relatively short description of this idea can be accessed through the <a href="https://assessment.uncc.edu/student-learning-outcomes/resources/triangulation-student-learning-outcomes-assessment" target="_blank">UNC Charlotte Office of Academic Affairs</a> Regardless, its utility is widespread and so much so that it has been a default measure within <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-your-document-s-readability-and-level-statistics-85b4969e-e80a-4777-8dd3-f7fc3c8b3fd2" target="_blank">Microsoft Word</a> for nearly twenty years.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Run some reliability checks<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> of one to three constructs (not items - you group items together to assess a construct). Then decide which single measure most accurately describes the true internal consistency. Defend your choice with a maximum 280 word (aka 1 Tweet’s worth) or less argument. My advice is to first look at both the codebook and measures. Additionally, choose wisely because you’ll be addressing validity, or rather something called <strong>threats to validity</strong> next week.</li>

<p>Please submit the following using the Submission Portal on [eCampus](.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>an R script (.R format) with your name in the upper left-hand corner beside of a hashtag # so it appears as a comment. Again please provgide comments where it is not obvious what you are doing. Perpetually, an example script is included which can be accessed <a href="/exscripts/example_script.R" target="_blank">here</a>. The more directions you include, the better the response! You may either right click and download the file to open it or copy and paste the content to your own blank script.</p></li>
