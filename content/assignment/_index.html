<p>This section contains descriptions of course tasks. Materials will be posted on a weekly basis. Please note that these pages populate information about course related tasks on the left hand side <strong>when they are assigned</strong>. Due dates are given with the description of each assignment.</p>
<div id="keeping-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Keeping Up</h2>
<p>There are a lot of moving parts to this class. Students who gain the most out of the course generally follow these general notions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Engaging with the readings and materials;</li>
<li>Putting in a good faith effort but also asking for help when needed;</li>
<li>Keeping a respectful, open, and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="evaluation-workgroups" class="section level2">
<h2>Evaluation Workgroups</h2>
<p>You will need to form 2 - 4 member support and project groups. There will be a discussion board where you can discuss available times in your schedules for group chats and there will be a group signup tool in Slack<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Once you have completed sign up, Slack will automatically privatize your group.</p>

<div id="weekly-postings" class="section level3">
<h3>Weekly Postings</h3>
<p>I will create discussion boards for a variety of purposes including discussing general course questions / logistics, getting to know each other, getting organized into groups, discussing each assignment, etc. You will need to participate actively on each board and your postings should be meaningful and incorporate depth. Responses without any additional information and/or justifications will be considered to be incomplete and will reflect on your final earned point value. The Slack site will include an assignments section organized by week. Within each week, I will post a description of everything you should complete for that week, including discussion board postings, chat room prompts and scaffolding, readings, and assignments as applicable. In addition to working together in the chat rooms, these groups will also do presentations and an evaluation project together. All members must contribute to all of these activities equitably; all members will receive the same grade on all group assignments. If any challenges or contention arise among group members, please let me know immediately so I can address the issue appropriately.</p>
<p>These postings will be graded using a check system:</p>
<ul>
<li>✔+: (<em>11.5 points (115%) in the gradebook</em>) Postings address a topic area completely and arguments are exceptional with plenty of justifications. These are not earned often.</li>
<li>✔: (<em>10 points (100%) in the gradebook</em>) Postings mostly address a topic area completely and/or arguments are on point. This is the expected level of performance.</li>
<li>✔−: (<em>5 points (50%) in the gradebook</em>) Postings generally fail to address a topic area completely and/or arguments are on off-point This is the expected level of performance. This indicates that you need to improve next time. Hopefully people will not earn this often.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise <em>0 points (0%) in the gradebook</em>.</p>

<div id="synchronous-meetings" class="section level3">
<h3>Synchronous Meetings</h3>
<p>There are two types of meetings in this class: <em>ongoing</em> and <em>check-in</em>. Please see the details below for an explanation of each.</p>
<div id="ongoing" class="section level4">
<h4>Ongoing</h4>
<p>You will need to meet weekly in the chat room to discuss your understanding, questions, and challenges with the readings, upcoming assignments, etc. I will provide prompts and scaffolding for your discussions. A one page summary consisting of who attended the meeting, content and general synopsis must submitted to eCampus unless otherwise noted.</p>
</div>
<div id="check-in" class="section level4">
<h4>Check-in</h4>
<p>We will need to meet at least six (6) times over the course of term. the primary purpose of this is not just to get to know you, but also to answer any questions you may have and to get an idea of what areas need to be addressed. My job is to serve as a mentor during your evaluation but that requires you to ask questions and be up to date on the course material. I will be using terminology that has been covered and without a frame of reference, the conversation may be difficult.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="evaluation-deliverables" class="section level3">
<h3>Evaluation Deliverables</h3>
<p>There are four primary deliverables in the course -</p>

<p>After identifying a program, your group will be tasked to conduct at least one interview and/or focus group using an approved medium of the primary stakeholder(s) and/or sponsor(s).</p>
</div>
<div id="evaluation-proposal" class="section level4">
<h4>Evaluation Proposal</h4>
<p>A full proposal of the anticipated evaluation framework including a discussion of the program, its needs, and intended approach/methods.</p>

<p>Depending on the program you evaluate and on how you end up conceptualizing your evaluation study, these assignments may be modified in order to make them more meaningful and applicable to your needs and interests. Further details may be found the individual task documents. Never hesitate to discuss any issues you have relative to the assignments with me. More about these task will be posted in the following weeks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="presentation-of-results" class="section level3">
