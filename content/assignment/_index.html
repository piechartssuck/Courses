<p>Foremost please note that these pages populate information about course related tasks on the left hand side <strong>when they are assigned</strong>. Due dates are given within the description of each assignment.</p>
<div id="keeping-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Keeping Up</h2>
<p>There are a lot of moving parts to this class. Students who gain the most out of the course generally follow these general notions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Engaging with the readings and materials;</li>
<li>Following all R related materials and using the software to complete any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling" target="_blank">data wrangling</a> or analysis;</li>
<li>Putting in a good faithed effort but also asking for help when needed;</li>
<li>Keeping a respectful, open, and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="lessons" class="section level2">
<h2>Lessons</h2>
<p>Most class sessions have <a href="/lesson/">interactive lessons</a> via <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">Data Camp</a>. Your task is simply to go through these.</p>
<p>I will grade these short exercises using a check system:</p>
<ul>
<li>✔+: (<em>11.5 points (115%) in gradebook</em>) Modules are 100% completed. Every task was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. These are not earned often.</li>
<li>✔: (<em>10 points (100%) in gradebook</em>) Modules are 70–99% complete and most answers are correct or on point. This is the expected level of performance.</li>
<li>✔−: (<em>5 points (50%) in gradebook</em>) Modules are less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect or off-point. This indicates that you need to improve next time. Hopefully people will not earn this often.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise <em>0 points (0%) in gradebook</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercises" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<p>Some classes also have <a href="/example/">fully annotated examples</a> of CSS, HTML, Javascript or R code that teach and demonstrate how to do specific tasks in R we cover here or elsewhere and on <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/" target="_blank">Data Camp</a>. Your task will be to submit a materials to show that these have been applied.</p>
<p>I will grade these short exercises using a check system:</p>
<ul>
<li>✔+: (<em>11.5 points (115%) in gradebook</em>) Exercises are 100% completed. Every task was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Knitted document are clean and easy to follow. This indicates that your work is exceptional. These are not earned often.</li>
<li>✔: (<em>10 points (100%) in gradebook</em>) Exercises are 70–99% complete and most answers are correct or on point. This is the expected level of performance.</li>
<li>✔−: (<em>5 points (50%) in gradebook</em>) Exercises are less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect or off-point. This indicates that you need to improve next time. Hopefully people will not earn this often.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I am not grading your coding ability, checking each line of code or syntax to make sure it produces the exact output, and most importantly, I am not looking for perfection! Try hard, get frustrated, do good work and you’ll get a ✓ or even a ✔+.</p>
<p>I encourage you to work together on the courses if possible, but you must turn in your own work on <a href="https://ecampus.wvu.edu" target="_blank">eCampus</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise <em>0 points (0%) in gradebook</em>.</p>

<div id="final-task" class="section level2">
<h2>Final Task</h2>
<p>At the end of the course, you will demonstrate your survey skills by completing a final report and presentation. Complete details for this will be posted here soon. To preview, you will need to document the processes reralted to survey planning, design, piloting, distribution, data collection, analysis, and reporting.</p>
<p>The project will <strong><em>not</em></strong> be graded using a check system. If you’ve engaged with the course content and completed the exercises and other course items throughout the course, you should do just fine with the course task.</p>

<h2>A Note About Discussion Board Postings</h2>
<p>While you may like or even love them, I hate discussion board posts. I hated them as a graduate student and still hate them as a professor. I recently made the decision to never use discussion board posts again for many reasons which are not useful to discuss here.</p>
<p>I always prefer face to face or at least conferencing if needed. With that said, we have Zoom and a <a href="https:/2020edp613.slack.com">Slack channel</a> so please use both!</p>
