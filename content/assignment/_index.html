<h2>Keeping Up</h2>
<p>There are a lot of moving parts to this class. Students who gain the most out of the course generally follow these general notions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Engaging with the readings and materials;</li>
<li>Following all R related materials and using the software to complete any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling" target="_blank">data wrangling</a> or analysis;</li>
<li>Putting in a solideffort but also asking for help when needed;</li>
<li>Keeping a respectful, open, and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.</li>
</ol>

<div id="lessons" class="section level2">
<h2>Lessons</h2>
<p>Most class sessions have <a href="/lesson/">interactive modules</a> via <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">Data Camp</a>. Your task is simply to go through these.</p>
<p>I will grade these modules using a check system:</p>
<ul>
<li>✔+: (<em>11.5 points (115%) in gradebook</em>) Modules are 100% completed. Every task was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. These are not earned often.</li>
<li>✔: (<em>10 points (100%) in gradebook</em>) Modules are 70–99% complete and answers are more or less on point. This is the expected level of performance.</li>
<li>✔−: (<em>5 points (50%) in gradebook</em>) Modules are less than 70% complete and most answers are generally off-point. This indicates that you likely need to do something like putting in ore of an effort or asking for help. Hopefully people will not earn this often.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise <em>0 points (0%) in gradebook</em>.</p>
<div id="need-help" class="section level3">
<h3>Need Help?</h3>
<p>I always prefer a face to face meeting if possible. With that said, we have Zoom and a <a href="https:/2021edp617.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack channel</a> let’s meet if you need help!</p>
