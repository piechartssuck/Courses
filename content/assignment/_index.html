<p>You will get the most of out this class if you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>engage with the readings and materials,</li>
<li>use R to complete any analysis,</li>
<li>ask for help immediately after giving <strong>it</strong> (whatever it is) a good faith effort, and</li>
<li>keep an open and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each type of assignment in this class helps with at least one one of these criteria.</p>
<div id="reflections" class="section level2">
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>To encourage engagement with the course content, you’ll need to write a ~150 word reflection about the readings for the day. That’s fairly short as there are ~250 words on a typical double-spaced page in Microsoft Word (500 when single-spaced).</p>
<p>You can do a lot of different things with this memo: discuss something you learned from the course content, write about the best or worst type of measure you’ve seen, connect the course content to your own work, etc. These reflections let you explore and answer some of the key questions of this course, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is measurement?</li>
<li>Why do we measure?</li>
<li>Can everything be measured? Should everything be measured?</li>
<li>What makes up a valid and reliable measure? What makes up a poor measure?</li>
<li>How do you choose which type of measure to use?</li>
</ul>
<p>The course content for each day will also include a set of questions specific to that topic. <em>You do not have to answer all (or any) of these questions</em>. That would be impossible. They exist to guide your thinking, that’s all.</p>
<p>I will grade these memos using a check system:</p>
<ul>
<li>✔+: (<em>11.5 points (115%) in gradebook</em>) Reflection shows phenomenal thought and engagement with the course content. I will not assign these often.</li>
<li>✔: (<em>10 points (100%) in gradebook</em>) Reflection is thoughtful, well-written, and shows engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance.</li>
<li>✔−: (<em>5 points (50%) in gradebook</em>) Reflection is hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else is scored as a 0 which should signal that this is essentially a scaled completion-based system. I am not grading your writing ability, counting the exact number of words you’re writing, or looking for citations from the reading(s). I am looking for thoughtful engagement and that’s it! Do good work and you’ll earn a ✓.</p>
<p>Please turn these weekly reflections in the Submission Portal on <a href="https://ecampus.wvu.edu/webapps/login/" target="_blank">eCampus</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercises" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<p>Each class session has <a href="/lesson/">interactive lessons</a> and <a href="/example/">fully annotated examples</a> of code that teach and demonstrate how to do specific tasks in R via <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">Data Camp</a>. You can easily find answers online but without practicing these foundational aspects of R, you may have trouble later! Note that this is also essentially a pass/fail system:</p>
<ul>
<li>✔+: (<em>11.5 points (115%) in gradebook</em>) Exercises are 100% completed. Every task was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Knitted document is clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.</li>
<li>✔: (<em>10 points (100%) in gradebook</em>) Exercises are 70–99% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance.</li>
<li>✔−: (<em>5 points (50%) in gradebook</em>) Exercises are less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I am not grading your coding ability, checking each line of code or syntax to make sure it produces the exact output, and most importantly, I am not looking for perfection! Try hard, get frustrated, do good work and you’ll get a ✓.</p>
<p>I encourage you to work together on the courses if possible, but you must turn in your own work on Data Camp.</p>

<div id="situations" class="section level2">
<h2>Situations</h2>
<p>To give you practice with the data and design principles you’ll learn in this class, you will complete three mini projects consisting of situations that necessitate some concept related to assessment and measurement. I will provide you with real-world data and pose one or more questions—you will answer those questions. Sometimes this involves just answering using what you’ve learnt while others involve using R to assess data.</p>
<p>The submissions will be graded using a check system:</p>
<ul>
<li>✔+: (<em>85 points (≈115%) in gradebook</em>) Project is phenomenally well-designed and uses advanced R techniques. The project uncovers an important story that is not readily apparent from just looking at the raw data. I will not assign these often.</li>
<li>✔: (<em>75 points (100%) in gradebook</em>) Project is fine, follows most design principles, answers a question from the data, and uses R correctly. This is the expected level of performance.</li>
<li>✔−: (<em>37.5 points (50%) in gradebook</em>) Project is missing large components, is poorly designed, does not answer a relevant question, and/or uses R incorrectly. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because these tasks give you practice for the final project, I will provide you with extensive feedback on your submissions.</p>

<div id="final-project" class="section level2">
<h2>Final project</h2>
<p>Throughout the course, you will have weekly opportunities to expand and refine your skill set culminating in the development of an instrument which will serve as a final project<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<div id="anchorwk1">
<details>
<summary>Week 1: Think about assessment.</summary>
<br>
<p>
Construct a one paragraph case for a population<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> that needs to be researched, why it should be be studied, and how the data would be quantitative.
</p>
</details>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div id="anchorwk2">
<details>
<summary>Week 2: Create an argument. </summary>
<br>
<p>
Submit a one to three page proposal outlining specific questions that you would like to assess and then describe an instrument that would be used to assess those items. Include general details on what measures would be used.
</p>
</details>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div id="anchorwk3">
<details>
<summary>Week 3. Develop a draft.</summary>
<br>
<p>
Create a draft of your instrument<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> by whatever medium you choose and then derive a skeleton. Map the measures directly to the items and group them if possible.
</p>
</details>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div id="anchorwk4">
<details>
<summary>Week 4. Refine the draft.</summary>
<br>
<p>
Based on feedback, amend the instrument if necessary and resubmit for further assessment. Explicitly detail what changes were made using a matrix. After approval, administer the instrument for pilot testing.
</p>
</details>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div id="anchorwk5">
<details>
<summary>Week 5. Address a priori and post analyses.</summary>
<br>
<p>
Submit a one to three page with a description of what approaches were used to assess validity and reliability, and all corresponding data and analyses by csv and an R script, respectively.
</p>
</details>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div id="anchorwk6">
<details>
<summary>Week 6. Refine and submit final instrument.</summary>
<br>
<p>
After amending, submit the final version of your instrument.
