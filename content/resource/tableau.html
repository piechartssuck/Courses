<h2>A Few Notes About Tableau</h2>
<p>Searching for help with Tableau on Google is generally easier than R since you aren’t searching for a letter. However, the first thing you may notice is that given <a href="https://www.tableau.com/" target="_blank">Tableau</a> is a proprietary software, there is severe lack of available free resources as opposed to R<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. As opposed to open source softwares, you may have difficulties in locating resources that are not commercially linked and worth an investigation.</p>
<p>Similar to how Apple operates, Tableau’s parent company <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a> tightly controls the ecosystem. However for those who want to avoid coding from the ground up, one of major benefits of the visualization software is that it plays well with R. However even with that capability, the interaction is narrowly defined. It also has the largest commercial footprint of those who prefer to pay for a graphical user interface when rendering data visualizations.</p>

People are extremely friendly and are willing to provide help as long as you have made a genuine attempt.</p>
