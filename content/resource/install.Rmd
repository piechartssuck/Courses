You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}. You will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"} as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.


## RStudio.cloud

R and Rstudio are free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can for the time being use the free [RStudio.cloud](http://rstudio.cloud/){target="_blank"} service *initially*, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won't have to install anything on your computer to get started with R but note that you will have to transition over to an installed version by midpoint 

Go to <https://rstudio.cloud/> and create an account to get started.

## The Case for RStudio on your computer > RStudio.cloud

RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since RStudio.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica. 

Here's how you install all these things

### Install R

First you need to install R itself (the engine).

1. Go to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)^[It's a goofy name, but CRAN is where most R packages—and R itself—lives.] website: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
2. Click on "Download R^[In the off chance you are a Linux user and cannot install R, I will gladly help you. Just let me know.] for `XXX`", where `XXX` is either Mac or Windows:

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
    include_graphics("/img/install/install-r-links.png", error = FALSE)
    ```
    As of this writing, the current version of R is 4.0.3 (Bunny-Wunnies Freak Out - yup that's the name of the release because why not?) but if there is an update, please download that instead.
    
    - If you use macOS, scroll down to the first `.pkg` file in the list of files  
    
        ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
        include_graphics("/img/install/install-r-mac.png", error = FALSE)
        ```
        - If you use Windows, click "base" (or click on the bolded "install R for the first time" link) and download it. 
    
        ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
        include_graphics("/img/install/install-r-windows.png", error = FALSE)
        ```

3. Double click on the downloaded file and install as usual (check your `Downloads` folder if it does not open up for some reason). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.

4. **This step is only for those with a Mac. If you have a Linux of Windows based machine, you can start installing RStudio**. macOS requires and extra software package to render graphics properly. Please [download and install XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/){target="_blank"}. 


### Install RStudio

Next, you need to install RStudio, graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R forever^[except to update it.] and only use RStudio. RStudio will detect and use R automatically. 

As of this writing, the current version of RStudio is 1.4.1103 but like R, if there is an update please download that instead.

1. Go to the free download location on RStudio's website: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>
2. The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and a corresponding download button:

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
    include_graphics("/img/install/install-r-rstudio-mac.png", error = FALSE)
    ```
    
    If not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
    include_graphics("/img/install/install-r-rstudio-windows.png", error = FALSE)
    ```

3. Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your `Downloads` folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.

Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder and/or shortcuts menu).


### Install `tidyverse`

R packages are mostly easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on "Install," type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%"}
include_graphics("/img/install/install-r-package-panel.png", error = FALSE)
```

This can sometimes be tedious when you're installing lots of packages, though. [The tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including **ggplot2**) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.

Go to the packages panel in RStudio, click on "Install," type "tidyverse", and press enter. You'll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
include_graphics("/img/install/install-r-tidyverse.png", error = FALSE)
```

Notice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: `install.packages("tidyverse")`. You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.
