<p>While there is no specific rubric, here is a basic outline of what to be looking out for in each task. Criteria will generally be graded on a competency-based scale roughly translating to</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A: Exceeds expectations</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>B: Meets expectations</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>C: Needs improvement</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>D: Unsatisfactory</strong>, and</li>
<li><strong>F: Overall Failing</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course this is a continuous scale so a combination of proficiencies may be assigned to work that falls between any two consecutive levels.</p>
