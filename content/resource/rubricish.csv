Justification of approach,Justification is not attepted or is incorrect,Justification of approach has multiple major flaws that affect the outcome,Justification of approach has one major flaw such as having a rendered visualization is not justified or is incorrectly defined,Justification has minor flaws such as being somewhat wordy  not straight to the point,The chosen analysis approach and visualizations are clearly explained and justified
Code,Code is not attepted or is incorrect,Code has major flaws which lead to errors,"Code has minor flaws, is difficult to follow, or includes lines or chunks that are unnecessary possibly leading to errors","Code is correct and runs without errors, but has minor problems with formatting or explanations","Code is correct, easy to read, properly formatted, runs without errors and properly explained"
Visualization,Visualziation(s) are not attepted or are incorrect,At least one visualization has major flaws resulting in a barely comprehensible or entirely inappropriate rendering,"At least one visualization has substantial flaw with legibility, labeling or rendering ","The visualizations have minor flaw such as those with legibility, labeling, or the chosen geom is adequate but incurs data loss ","The visualizations are appropriate, easy to read, properly labeled and utilize correct aesthetics"
Outcomes,Explanation is not attepted or is incorrect,Explanation has at least one major flaw in logic affecting the outcome in a substantial way,Explanation has a secondary flaw in logic that does not affect the outcome in a substantial way,"Explanation is mostly clear and correct, but has minor inaccuracies or lacks needed depth",Discussion of results is clear and correct with needed needed depth devoid of being wordy
