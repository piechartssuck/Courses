<h3><span style="color:#1B609D">General Outline</span></h3>
<ul>

<li><p><strong>Justification</strong>. You must include evidence from, at minimum, the items we have covered in the course so far as a defense for your approach. In this case, you are providing an evidence-based argument for the way you want to conduct the study. At minimum, the topics covered here should address an intended evaluative framework/orientation/model/approach that will guide your program evaluation and answer how this construct will be well-suited to evaluate the program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methodology</strong>. This section will be the largest and most detailed component. This is will be your chance to detail the intended evaluative process and to justify your methodological approach. At minimum, please cover the following where applicable</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sampling frame</strong>. A description of the overall targeted population and sample that you have drawn or will draw. This includes a description of the primary stakeholders, or those you are studying, and secondary stakeholders, or those who are not directly affected by the program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assessment of Values</strong>. Address what set of values you will be using in your evaluation. This should be very explicit, and you must explain where these came from?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Existing Data</strong>. If applicable, provide a description of what existing data will you be using within your evaluation, how you plan on accessing that data and what form the raw data will be in.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Collection</strong>. Discuss what data you will utilize within your evaluation, how you will collect that data, what instruments and/or materials you will be using or plan to use, and how you will gain permission from those who are participating.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analysis</strong>. Provide a narrative on the type of raw data you will have. Address how you intend to analyze the quantitative, qualitative, and or mixed data you will have.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reporting Cycle</strong>. Briefly discuss how the results will be reported to the sponsor, when you intend to do so, and if you are intending to provide an interim report.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Statement of Intent</strong>. On a separate page, please provide a one paragraph statement of intent on whether you plan to <em>use</em> or <em>publish</em> your work beyond the framework of this course and your corresponding reasoning. Please note that <em>use</em> implies</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the report as proof of an evaluation having been performed.</li>
<li>Creating a manuscript for a possible publication within a journal[May earn an extra 10% on the final score.].</li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<h4><span style="color:#1B609D">Note About Usage</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Using your evaluation in any capacity outside of the course requires a client authorization.</li>
<li>An IRB submission may also also required but should not be included in your submission. You may however submit this request through the <a href="https://oric.research.wvu.edu/wvu-kc" target="_blank">WVU+kc system</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please be sure of your intent! The way in which I consult you will differ based on your statement. This is extremely important primarily due to writing styles, in that the narrative in an academic report often differs significantly from the body of an academic paper.</em></p>

<li><strong>external deliverable</strong>. Your final report submitted to the sponsor that is written to be easily accessible and consumable</li>
<li><strong>evaluation assessment</strong><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Form a <em>coherent</em> and <em>detailed</em> narrative addressing what you would do differently given the chance to perform your evaluation over again. You can think of this as a reflection of all activities and personnel associated with the evaluation. Specificity, clarity and distinct connections to the course content will be key here.</li>
<li>(optional) <strong>client authorization</strong>. If anybody on your team intends to use this report outside of this course in any capacity (e.g. as an example of work), you must submit a signed release from the sponsor. This serves as a binding document.<br />
