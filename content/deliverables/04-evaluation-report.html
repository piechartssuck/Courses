<p>
Your team submission should include the following components separated into three parts
1. <strong>external deliverable</strong>. Your final report submitted to the sponsor that is written to be easily accessible and consumable
2. <strong>evaluation assessment</strong><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Form a <em>coherent</em> and <em>detailed</em> narrative addressing what you would do differently given the chance to perform your evaluation over again. You can think of this as a reflection of all activities and personnel associated with the evaluation. Specificity, clarity and distinct connections to the course content will be key here.
3. (optional) <strong>client authorization</strong>. If anybody on your team intends to use this report outside of this course in any capacity (e.g. as an example of work), you must submit a signed release from the sponsor. This serves as a binding document.

<span style="color:#9d1b76"><strong>Example Manuscript Outline</strong></span>
</summary>
<p>
<p>Your items must be in the standard formatting and structure outlined by your primary journal of choice. A broad list of sections and descriptions are provided below. However, *<strong>always use the formatting and structure defined by your journal of choice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Title</strong>. The title should be specific and indicate the problem the research project addresses using term that will be helpful in searches should your paper be published.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keywords</strong>. Publishers will more often than not ask you to provide up to five keywords that are generally describe elements of your manuscript.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Letter to the Editor</strong>. Most journals require a letter to the editor where you must make an argument in narrative form explain why you believe the submission fits the journal. You should absolutely review the description of the journal where they often describe what types of submissions will be considered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Abstract</strong>. The abstract is used by readers to quickly review the overall content of the paper. Journals typically place strict word limits on abstracts, such as 200 words, making them a challenge to write. The abstract should provide a complete synopsis of the research paper and should introduce the topic and the specific research question, provide a statement regarding methodology and should provide a general statement about the results and the findings. Because it is really a summary of the entire research paper, it is often written last.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduction</strong>. The introduction begins by introducing the broad overall topic and providing basic background information. It then narrows down to the specific research question relating to this topic. It provides the purpose and focus for the rest of the paper and sets up the justification for the research.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Literature Review</strong>. The purpose of the literature review is to describe past important research and it relate it specifically to the research problem. It should be a synthesis of the previous literature and the new idea being researched. The review should examine the major theories related to the topic to date and their contributors. It should include all relevant findings from credible sources, such as academic books and peer-reviewed journal articles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methods</strong>. The methods section will describe the research design and methodology used to complete to the study. The general rule of thumb is that readers should be provided with enough detail to replicate the study.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analysis</strong>. The analysis section will describe your approach to analyzing your data set(s). The general rule of thumb is that readers should be provided with enough detail to replicate the study.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Results</strong>. In this section, the results of the analysis are presented. How the results are presented will depend upon whether the research study was quantitative or qualitative in nature. This section should focus only on results that are directly related to the research or the problem. Graphs and tables should only be used when there is too much data to efficiently include it within the text. You should absolutely present the results, but not discuss their significance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discussion or Conclusion</strong>. This section should be a discussion of the results and the implications on the field, as well as other fields. The hypothesis should be answered and validated by the interpretation of the results. This section should also discuss how the results relate to previous research mentioned in the literature review, any cautions about the findings, and potential for future research.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>References or Bibliography</strong>. The research paper is not complete without the list of references. This section should be an alphabetized list of all the academic sources of information utilized in the paper. The format of the references will match the format and style used in the paper. Common formats include APA, MLA, Harvard and so forth.</p></li>
