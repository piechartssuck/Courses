<p>Take your time with these modules. I suggest setting 8-10 hours for this initial set and to spread the walkthroughs out over the week if possible and it is conducive to your learning style. The first module gives you an understand of the R environment while the second deals with data wrangling and reshaping, namely making sure data is in a “tidy” format. We’ll be using this idea moving forward in the course. Please reach out if you need help!</p>
