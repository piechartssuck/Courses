                "Review some materials on survey items and get an overview of one of the most important types of analyses: **Item Response Theory** (IRT). We'll learn more about IRT and cover **exploratory factor analysis** (EFA) next week!"),

### What's Due?
<center>
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
kable(wk_post, 
      escape = FALSE,
      align = 'cccll') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "10em") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "10em") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "10em") %>%
  column_spec(4, width = "22em") %>%
  column_spec(5, width = "10em")
```

### Things to Consider 
While there is nothing to turn in this week, please think about your [plan of analysis](/assignment/11-assignment/#plan-of-analysis-1) ahead of time.
