<h2>The Course Text</h2>
<p>Each class session has a set of required readings that you should complete <strong><em>before</em></strong> doing anything else. It also allows you to ask questions prior to moving on! With that said, think of the text as a reference, in that</p>
<ul>
<li>it contains a lot of stuff that you may use but probably won’t right now, and</li>
<li>it gives you a basis to ask intelligent questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you should absolutely read it to get a basis but in the long run, you will learn more from this course by doing.</p>

<h2>The Course Nontext</h2>
<p>Many of us are visual learners with me included, so a lot of what I provide outside of the text is visually based. Resources such as presentations, videos, visualizations, walkthroughs, etc. take a lot of time to construct so please take some time to go through them. Are they Hollywood? No because I’m a professor at a public university, have three children and drive a car with duct tape on it BUT they’ll be decent. I am always open to suggestions so if you have any, send them along!
