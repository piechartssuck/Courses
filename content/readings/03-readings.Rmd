  - a reflection / reaction to the content *and*
  - a question about something specific

#### Note about the posts 
**Remember this is a graduate level class and your writing should reflect that**. Moreover, these postings should be in APA 7th Edition formatting unless otherwise noted. The following general idea will be used when assessing your *initial posts*, but this is not a rubric. 

- ✔+: (*11.5 points in gradebook*) Posts are well defined responses that fully address and develop all aspects of the prompt such that they
  + advance the discussion, 
  + are factually correct, 
  + are cited correctly when necessary, *and*
  + provide a clear, concise, reflective and substantive contribution.
- ✔: (*10 points in gradebook*) Posts well defined responses that mostly address all aspects of the prompt such that they
  + generally advances the discussion, 
  + are factually correct, 
  + are cited correctly when necessary, *but*
  + lack clarity or full development of the concept(s). 
- ✔−: (*5 points in gradebook*) Posts responses that address some aspects of the prompt where responses are
  + not clear *or*
  + ill-prepared *or*
  + repetitive *or*
  + superficial *or*
  + unsubstantiated.
- ✘: (*0 points in gradebook*) Posts responses that are
  + non existent *or*
  + incorrect *or*
  + irrelevant to the discussion *or*
  + off-topic.

Otherwise *0 points (0%) in gradebook*.
