## Readings

- The [syllabus](/syllabus/), [content](/content/), [lessons](/lesson/), [examples](/example/), and [assignments](/assigment/) pages for this class

### Questions to reflect on

- What is a measure?
- How do we actually know if a variable is actually numerical or categorical?
- Should validity or reliability be tested first?
- What relationship do evaluation and measurement have?
- Should all quantitative data have measures?

Note: These reflection items *can* be integrated into this week's reflection which is item #2 in the [Exercise I Task]().
