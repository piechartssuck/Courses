## Read

- <i class="fas fa-book fa-fw"></i> Chapters 10-12 in James McDavid, *Program Evaluation and Performance Measurement*. 

- <i class="fas fa-book fa-fw"></i> [Chapter 10](https://www.thetaminusb.com/intro-measurement-r/dimensionality.html){target="_blank"} in Tony Albano, *Introduction to Educational and Psychological Measurement Using R*. There is not a hint of syntax in this chapter, rather its just a decent summary of the primary items related to measurement. Please skim it over to see if you have compartmentalized the ideas related to each.

## Suggestions

Start working on your final proposal. If you want feedback on some chunks of your narrative (at most three paragraphs unless we have discussed prior), please send them along. I'll provide this on a first come-first serve basis. 

### Questions to reflect on

- What can a factor analysis do when assessing surveys?
- What types of questions can a factor analysis answer?
- What do the different types of factor analyses do and how could they inform specific parts of an questionnaire?
