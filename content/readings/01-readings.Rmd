<br>
<iframe src="/videos/snoop_syllabus.mp4" width="320" height="480" frameBorder="0">Read the syllabus.</iframe>

<br>Far be it from us to disagree with Snoop, so you should probably go read the [syllabus](/syllabus/) as soon as possible!

### Review Syllabus
Review the overviews of the other areas as well:  [content](/content/), [lessons](/lesson/), [examples](/example/), and [assignments](/assigment/) pages for this class.

### Book Stuff
Read *Chapter 1:Sample Surveys in Our Electronic World* in Dillman, Smyth, and Christian.
