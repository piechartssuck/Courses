<br>Far be it from us to disagree with Snoop, so you should probably go read the [syllabus](/syllabus/) as soon as possible!

### Review the Rest
Review the overviews of the other areas as well:  [Assignments](/assigment/), [Examples](/example/), [Lessons](/lesson/), and [Schedule](/schedule/) pages for this class.

### Read the Book
There is nothing to read just yet!
