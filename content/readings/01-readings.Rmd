## Note

This week and only this week please complete the R [training modules](/datacamp/) before reading the Albano text.

## Literature

- <i class="fas fa-file fa-fw"></i> **Read** the [syllabus](/syllabus/)
- <i class="fas fa-book fa-fw"></i> **Review** Part I: The Essence of Research in the Counseling Profession covering Chapters 1-4 in Balkin & Kleist.
- **Read** through <i class="fas fa-book fa-fw"></i> [Chapter 1](https://www.thetaminusb.com/intro-measurement-r/introduction.html){target="_blank"} in Albano titled [an] *Introduction to Educational and Psychological Measurement Using R*. It is absolutely fine if you cannot understand some of what is presented, especially the syntax. Copy and paste the code into your R console to follow along. 
- Read [Visser, et al. (2020)](/documents/Visser et al (2020).pdf) and answer the following question in a posting on the Slack channel  [#psychopathic-sims](https://2021edp611.slack.com/archives/C021WQ54BML): *Focusing on just the measures, what are your thoughts regarding the validity and reliablity of the study?*
