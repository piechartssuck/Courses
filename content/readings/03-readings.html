<p>Note: Firefox appears to have some problems rendering the formulas in the text properly. Google Chrome, Safari, and Tor do not appear to have this problem. With that said, <strong>I am not concerned whether you know a formula or not, rather I want you to understand the general idea so please take your time on Chapter 5!</strong></p>

<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<p>Take some time to review or get a first look at some basic statistics. Again, I do not care if you can memorize a formula. We have these things called books and the Internet to get those. Rather if you can understand what’s going on and when to use a method (e.g. when is it more appropriate to take the mean, median, or mode of a sample).</p>
