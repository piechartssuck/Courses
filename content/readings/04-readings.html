<h2>Read</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><i class="fas fa-book fa-fw"></i> Chapters 8-9 in James McDavid, <em>Program Evaluation and Performance Measurement</em>. While not required Chapter 7 is on economic evaluation, that is the content is solely focused on assessing whether the potential or actual benefits from interventions are greater than the projected or existing loss in benefits from a reduction in other programs. If the idea of something like a cost-benefit analysis interests you, please read this.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="fas fa-book fa-fw"></i> <a href="https://www.thetaminusb.com/intro-measurement-r/itemanalysis.html" target="_blank">Chapters 6-7</a> in Tony Albano, <em>Introduction to Educational and Psychological Measurement Using R</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Firefox appears to have some problems rendering the formulas in the text properly. Google Chrome, Safari, and Tor do not appear to have this problem. With that said, <strong>Chapter 7 is somewhat dense and you are not expected to memorize formulas. Get the basic idea of what an IRT is and what it is used for and ask questions as needed!</strong></p>

<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<p>Next week we cover Item Response Theory (IRT) in greater detail. While Chapter 7 in Albano’s online text is a needed read, it is a bit difficult to fully comprehend at first so we’ll be emphasizing the procedural aspects of conducting one. If you want a grounded conceptual (not statistical or mathematical) introduction, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJNUIJnElUzDmrIPunMyF3tTvIHb65wNb" target="_blank">Karon F. Cook’s short 6-part series</a>. She does a really good job bringing a relatively high level concept down to Earth.</p>

<h3>Questions to reflect on</h3>
<p>This week first head over to the <a href="https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations" target="_blank">new version</a> and <a href="https://tylervigen.com/old-version.html" target="_blank">old version</a> of Spurious Correlations: the often hilarious and always ridiculous examples of why correlation doesn’t imply causation. Pick one out, paste it into a word document and then write a one paragraph narrative on</p>
<ul>
<li>why you chose the one that you did?</li>
<li>do you think correlation is ever enough? what is that point?</li>
<li>how do you think correlation is tied to measurement?</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuck? Please take a look at <a href="/handouts/bad_survey.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> read of some common survey design mistakes that lead to all kinds of measurement errors.</p>
