## Data Camp

This week please complete both the **Introduction to R** and **Introduction to the Tidyverse** courses on [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/). The modules cover an:

- Intro to basics
- Vectors
- Matrices
- Factors
- Data frames
- Lists
<br>
and
<br>
- Data wrangling
- Data visualization 
- Grouping and summarizing
- Types of visualizations

*Please take your time with these modules. While the first gives you an understand of the R environment, the second deals with data wrangling, namely making sure data is "tidy". We'll be using this idea moving forward in the course.*
