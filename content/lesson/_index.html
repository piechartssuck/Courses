<p>Lessons are used to both introduce content not covered in the text and to supplement materials already addressed. Materials will be posted on a weekly basis.</p>

<h3>Need Help?</h3>
<p>I always prefer a face to face meeting if possible but since thatâ€™s not possible, you can schedule a Zoom via the <a href="https://calendly.com/nopiecharts/short30" target="_blank">Calendar</a> or contact me within <a href="https://2021edp617.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> by tagging my name <code>@Dr. Abhik Roy</code> in a text box along with your message.</p>
