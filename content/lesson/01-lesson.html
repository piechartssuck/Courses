<h3>Data Camp</h3>
<p>The purpose of these modules is not have you become a programmer! Rather these lay a foundation for a common language and software weâ€™ll be using. Some are better than others and some are more technical than others as well. Just remember, this is not a programming class! Falling behind on these can make some material we cover in the course inaccessible. If you get stuck, please ask me for help, search the Internet or move on!</p>
<p>If you are feeling ambitious, please go ahead and start the first module covering the basics of R on <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/" target="_blank">Data Camp</a>. There is a lot on there and please refer to the <a href="/syllabus/">syllabus</a> for the grading policy regarding those tasks.</p>
