<h3>Data Camp</h3>
<p>While the first module is not due until next Friday, if you are feeling ambitious, please go ahead and start the first module covering the basics of R on <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/" target="_blank">Data Camp</a>. There is a lot on there but please refer to the <a href="/syllabus/">syllabus</a> for the grading policy regarding those tasks. Just remember, this is not a programming class!</p>
