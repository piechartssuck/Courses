### Data Camp
The first module is due on Sunday which covers the basics of R on [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/){target="_blank"}. It will cover:

- Intro to basics
- Vectors
- Matrices
- Factors
- Data frames
- Lists

As noted last week, there is a lot on there but please refer to the [syllabus](/syllabus/) for the grading policy regarding those tasks. Just remember, this is not a programming class!

### Evaluation
Download a slideshow both in [PowerPoint](/slides/Week 2/Intro to PE.pptx){target="_blank"} or [PDF](/slides/Week 2/Intro to PE.pdf){target="_blank"} formats to learn about or review foundational concepts in evaluation.
