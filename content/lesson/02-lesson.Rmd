### A Note About the Title

That 80% figure is based on the [Pareto Principal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle){target="_blank"} and is meant to be taken as a hyperbole. It roughly translates to the idea that 80 percent you time is spent simply finding, cleansing, and organizing data - aka wrangling - leaving only 20 percent for meaningful analyses.
