## Meeting
Please make sure to meet with me **after** submitting your proposal and receiving approval but **before** conducting your evaluation. I want to make sure you are all ready to go and that all of your questions are addressed before starting the proposed study. However I will be glad to meet with your group at any point prior to that!

## Collaborative, Participatory, & Empowerment Evaluation
Take a look at a [one-pager](/handouts/Collaborative, Participatory, Empowerment Evaluation 1-Pager.pdf){target="_blank"} explaining the difference between collaborative, participatory and empowerment evaluation.

## Goal Free versus Goal Based
Go through this excellent [slideshow](/handouts/GFEvsGFB.pdf){target="_blank"} assessing the differences between a goal-based evaluation (GBE) which you are currently planning versus a goal-free evaluation (GFE). This was created by Dr. Brandon Youker who graduated from my doctoral program a year or two before me. While it is fantastic and well worth reviewing, please excuse the few instances of Comic Sans^[*Hint: Don't use Comic Sans*].

## Standards Based Evaluation

*Posting shortly*

<!--
To get an idea of how standards can be written including those related to evaluation questions and purposes, please view and listen to the **Standards-Based Evaluation** slideshow. You can also download a [PDF](/slides/Standards-Based Evaluation/Standards_Based_Evaluation.pdf){target="_blank"} of the presentation. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_url("/slides/Standards-Based Evaluation/Standards_Based_Evaluation.html")
```

You can move back and forth using <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd> and toggle fullscreen by pressing <kbd>F</kbd>. Just press <kbd>O</kbd>^[For **O**verview] at any point in your slideshow and a display of all slides, called tile view, will appear. Click on a slide to go there or press <kbd>O</kbd> to exit tile view. For more options, press <kbd>H</kbd> for help.
