## Evaluation Phase
We are currently in the evaluation process phase. This involves

```{r echo = FALSE}

unchecked <- as.character(fontawesome::fa("circle", fill = "#e4e4e4", height = "15px"))

checked <- as.character(fontawesome::fa("check-circle", fill = "#428bca", height = "15px"))

process <- tibble(
  
  phase = c("Process"),
  
  task = c("Administering an evaluation"),
  
  current <- c(checked)
  
)

```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
  process %>%
  kbl(escape = FALSE,
      align = 'llc') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "10em") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "10em") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "20em") %>% 
  row_spec(1, extra_css = 'vertical-align: middle !important;') 
```

## Evaluation Checklists

If you are a checklist type of person, consider taking a look at the many examples at the [*Evaluation Checklist Project*](https://wmich.edu/evaluation/checklists){target="_blank"} within the The Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University.

There is a likely a checklist for everything and all have been [validated](https://wmich.edu/evaluation/checklists/checklistsvalidation){target="_blank"}. Also if you create one that the project doesn't house, consider [submitting](https://wmich.edu/evaluation/checklists/checklist-submit){target="_blank"} it.
