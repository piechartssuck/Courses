<p>For a group of people who love conciseness, evaluators often use tools with soem complexity. Below are three chunks that are on a <strong>need to know so I can get hired and paid</strong> basis.</p>
<div id="evaluation-checklists" class="section level2">
<h2>Evaluation Checklists</h2>
<p>Evaluators love checklists and so much so that there is repository solely dedicated to housing them. Head over to <a href="https://wmich.edu/evaluation/checklists">The Evaluation Center</a> at Western Michigan University to take a look.</p>

<div id="logic-models" class="section level2">
<h2>Logic Models</h2>
<p>Logic models are simply a visual(ish) way to depict the moving parts of a program. Once constructed, it is a fairly easy way to guide parts of an evaluation and for stakeholders to see if changes need to occur. The <a href="https://fyi.extension.wisc.edu/programdevelopment/logic-models/">Program Development and Evaluation</a> supported by the University of Wisconsin Extension Program is a fantastic resource for all things logic model.</p>

<h2>A Whole Lot of Methods</h2>
<p>Being an evaluator is akin to “being a jack of all trades but a master of none.” That is not meant to be demeaning in any way (or else I’d just be putting myself down). We are typically methodologists and/or have an innate ability to construct studies to determine the needs of a program. However evaluators are rarely content experts and even if we are, the likelihood of evaluating something within our content is pretty low. Take a look at <a href="https://www.betterevaluation.org/en">Better Evaluation</a> to get an idea of the breadth of methods and approaches evaluators need to know in order to do their job effectively.</p>
