<p>This section contains extra material to help you understand a concepts covered for that week. Sometimes this is just a few links for you to look at and other times its fully annotated R code that you can use as a reference for helping you along with a task. Please access the material on this site this section after you have finished the reading(s).</p>
<p>From time to time, I may also contains video of coding some examples pieces so you can see what it looks like to work with R in real time. Youâ€™ll definitely notice that I make all sorts of errors, which <em>is absolutely normal</em> and happens to everyone!</p>
