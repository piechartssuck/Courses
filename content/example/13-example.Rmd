## Evaluation Phase
We are currently in the evaluation process phase. This involves

```{r echo = FALSE}

unchecked <- as.character(fontawesome::fa("circle", fill = "#e4e4e4", height = "15px"))

checked <- as.character(fontawesome::fa("check-circle", fill = "#428bca", height = "15px"))

process <- tibble(
  
  phase = c("Process"),
  
  task = c("Administering an evaluation"),
  
  current <- c(checked)
  
)

```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
  process %>%
  kbl(escape = FALSE,
      align = 'llc') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "10em") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "10em") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "20em") %>% 
  row_spec(1, extra_css = 'vertical-align: middle !important;') 
```

## Mixed Methods In Impact Evaluation

While we didn't get to cover a great deal beyond process based evaluations, arguably one of the most satisfying variants is those that study impacts. [Dr. Michael Bamberger](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/profile/michael-bamberger/){target="_blank"} is a [developmental evaluator](https://www.betterevaluation.org/en/plan/approach/developmental_evaluation){target="_blank"} wrote the highly cited report  [*Introduction To Mixed Methods In Impact Evaluation*](https://www.interaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mixed-Methods-in-Impact-Evaluation-English.pdf){target="_blank"}. If nothing else, take a look at the document to see what a well structured narrative and design looks like.
