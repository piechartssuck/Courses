<h3>In App Help</h3>
<p>First things first, once a package has been loaded, you can use a <code>?</code> in front of any command to get more information about it. Sometimes the descriptions and/or examples aren’t very helpful, but most of the time you should be able to find the information you are looking for.</p>

<h3>What’s This All About?</h3>
<p>Barring the first week, every other example provided is essentially a walkthrough. You may notice that all of the outputs are already done for you. The purpose of you going through the modules in Data Camp is to familiarize yourself of the structure and syntax.</p>

<h3>Need Help?</h3>
<p>I always prefer a face to face meeting if possible but since that’s not possible, you can schedule a Zoom via the <a href="https://calendly.com/nopiecharts/short30" target="_blank">Calendar</a> or contact me within <a href="http:/2021edp611.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> by tagging my name <code>@Dr. Abhik Roy</code> in a text box along with your message.</p>
