### First Timers Note
You will get the most of out this class if you:

1. engage with the readings and materials,
2. use R to complete any analysis^[If you prefer to use another piece of software for analyses, please note that those are not supported in this course, in that I will likely not be able to provide guidance since there is likely a lack of familiarity. It is highly recommended that you attempt to replicate the results in whatever medium you choose. That will give you time to research what steps are needed and to make corrections if necessary.],
3. ask for help immediately after giving *it* (whatever *it* is) a good faith effort, and
4. keep an open and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.

## Final Proposal Bits

Throughout the course, you will have weekly opportunities to expand and refine your skill set culminating in the development of an instrument which will serve as a final project^[These will ***not*** be graded using a check system. If you've engaged with the course content and completed the exercises and mini projects throughout the course, you should do just fine with the final project.]. Please include your name and submit all documents in either a `.docx` or `.pdf` format.

<div id="anchorwk1"> 
<details><summary>Week 1: Think about assessment.</summary>
<br>
<p>
Construct a one paragraph case for a population^[A population does not necessarily refer to people.] that needs to be researched, why it should be be studied, and how the data would be quantitative.
</p>
</details>
</div>
<br>

<div id="anchorwk2">
<details><summary>Week 2: Create an argument. </summary>
<br>
<p>
Submit a one to three page proposal outlining specific questions that you would like to assess and then describe an instrument that would be used to assess those items. Include general details on what measures would be used. 
</p>
</details>
</div>
<br>

<div id="anchorwk3">
<details><summary>Week 3. Develop a draft.</summary>
<br>
<p>
Create a draft of your instrument^[If the instrument is housed elsewhere (e.g. Qualtrics), then simply provide a link and ensure that access is granted to me.] by whatever medium you choose. Map the measures directly to the items and group them if possible. 
</p>
</details>
</div>
<br>

<div id="anchorwk4">
<details><summary>Week 4. Refine the draft.</summary>
<br>
<p>
Based on feedback, amend the instrument if necessary and resubmit for further assessment. Explicitly detail what changes were made using a matrix. After approval, administer the instrument for a simulation of responses.
</p>
</details>
</div>
<br>

<div id="anchorwk5">
<details><summary>Week 5. Test for validity and reliability.</summary>
<br>
<p>
Simulate data and then conduct an EFA to assess validity and a reliability analysis.
</p>
</details>
</div>
<br>

<div id="anchorwk6">
<details><summary>Week 6. Refine and submit final instrument.</summary>
<br>
<p>
After amending, submit the final version of your instrument along with a final description of each measure given by item or group of items. Each measure must be justifiable either by the use of statistical analysis, literature review, or some combination thereof.
</p>
</details>

### Need Help?
I always prefer a face to face meeting if possible but since that's not possible, you can schedule a Zoom via the [Calendar](https://calendly.com/nopiecharts/short30){target="_blank"} or contact me within [Slack](http:/2021edp611.slack.com){target="_blank"} by tagging my name `@Dr. Abhik Roy` in a text box along with your message.
