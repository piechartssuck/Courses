<p>You will get the most of out this class if you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>engage with the readings and materials,</li>
<li>use R to complete any analysis,</li>
<li>ask for help immediately after giving <strong>it</strong> (whatever it is) a good faith effort, and</li>
<li>keep an open and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each type of assignment in this class helps with at least one one of these criteria.</p>

<h2>Final proposal</h2>
<p>Throughout the course, you will have weekly opportunities to expand and refine your skill set culminating in the development of an instrument which will serve as a final project<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

Week 1: Think about assessment.
</summary>
<br>
<p>
Construct a one paragraph case for a population<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> that needs to be researched, why it should be be studied, and how the data would be quantitative.
</p>

<summary>
Week 2: Create an argument.
</summary>
<br>
<p>
Submit a one to three page proposal outlining specific questions that you would like to assess and then describe an instrument that would be used to assess those items. Include general details on what measures would be used.

Week 3. Develop a draft.
</summary>
<br>
<p>
Create a draft of your instrument<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> by whatever medium you choose and then derive a skeleton. Map the measures directly to the items and group them if possible.

<summary>
Week 4. Refine the draft.
</summary>
<br>
<p>
Based on feedback, amend the instrument if necessary and resubmit for further assessment. Explicitly detail what changes were made using a matrix. After approval, administer the instrument for pilot testing.
