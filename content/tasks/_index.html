<h2>Final Proposal Bits</h2>
<p>Throughout the course, you will have weekly opportunities to expand and refine your skill set culminating in the development of an instrument which will serve as a final project<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Please include your name and submit all documents in either a <code>.docx</code> or <code>.pdf</code> format.</p>

Week 1: Think about assessment.
</summary>
<br>
<p>
Construct a one paragraph case for a population<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> that needs to be researched, why it should be be studied, and how the data would be quantitative.

<h3>Need Help?</h3>
<p>I always prefer a face to face meeting if possible but since that’s not possible, you can schedule a Zoom via the <a href="https://calendly.com/nopiecharts/short30" target="_blank">Calendar</a> or contact me within <a href="http:/2021edp611.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> by tagging my name <code>@Dr. Abhik Roy</code> in a text box along with your message.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>If you prefer to use another piece of software for analyses, please note that those are not supported in this course, in that I will likely not be able to provide guidance since there is likely a lack of familiarity. It is highly recommended that you attempt to replicate the results in whatever medium you choose. That will give you time to research what steps are needed and to make corrections if necessary.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>These will <strong><em>not</em></strong> be graded using a check system. If you’ve engaged with the course content and completed the exercises and mini projects throughout the course, you should do just fine with the final project.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>A population does not necessarily refer to people.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>If the instrument is housed elsewhere (e.g. Qualtrics), then simply provide a link and ensure that access is granted to me.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
