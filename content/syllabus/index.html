</ol>
</div>
<div id="faq" class="section level2">
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div id="is-the-course-content-difficult" class="section level3">
<h3>Is the course content difficult?</h3>
<p>You’ve probably heard an answer like this before: <em>At times some of the material can be dense.</em> Well that isn’t much of a response. Difficulty is not the issue here since as humans with differing educational background, we will have strengths in some areas more than others. Instead the question is can you identify areas that need strengthened and communicate them? If you can, then you have a good shot at succeeding in this class.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-there-a-lot-of-theory" class="section level3">
<h3>Is there a lot of theory?</h3>
<p>Evaluation is a practice based field so much of what you will come across will align with that notion. With that said, while I have tried to get rid of any and all theory, some basic concepts need an underlying construct or idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-if-i-find-a-mistake" class="section level3">
<h3>What if I find a mistake?</h3>
<p>Tell me! I strive to be error free but like everyone else, make silly mistakes. This includes grammar and spelling errors as well!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="course-materials" class="section level2">
<h2>Course materials</h2>
<p>There are two texts, though you will receive some supplementary materials in the course as well.</p>

<h3>Texts</h3>
<div id="required" class="section level4">
<h4>Required</h4>
<p>We’ll rely on the texts below. Both are available through the WVU library <a href="https://library.wvu.edu/" target="_blank">WVU library</a>:</p>

<p>There will occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the content page for that session.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="software" class="section level3">
<h3>Software</h3>
<div id="quatrics" class="section level4">
<h4>Quatrics</h4>
<p>You will need access to your WVU <a href="https://wvu.qualtrics.com/" target="_blank">Qualtrics</a> account. Please go to the site and check if you can login. If you are enrolled as a WVU student, then you should have access. However if you do not, submit a <a href="https://wvu.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1976/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=9102" target="_blank">ticket to IT</a> or give them a ring at <a href="callto:%20304-293-4444">304-293-4444</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-and-rstudio-optional" class="section level4">
<h4>R and RStudio (Optional)</h4>
<p><strong><em>Again, this is totally optional but may interest some of you. If this is the case, please let me know and I will add you to the training modules.</em></strong></p>
<p>While required for most of the methods courses I teach, you have the option in this course to learn about the open source (and free!)statistical platform <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a> via the software <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">RStudio</a>. <strong>You can think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard</strong> — R handles all the calculations produces the actual statistics and graphical output, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code. Please note that</p>
<div class="text-center">
<p><strong>you do not need to have any programming experience to use R</strong></p>
</div>
<p>R is free, but it can sometimes be a task to install and configure. To make life easier, you can opt to use the free <a href="http://rstudio.cloud/" target="_blank">RStudio.cloud</a> service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This is recommended for those of you who do not want to install programs right now or just wabt to test it out.</p>
<p>The service is convenient, but please keep in mind that it can be slow and is not designed to handle large data sets or more complicated analysis and graphics. You also cannot customize much with RStudio.cloud. As you learn more, you’ll want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud.</p>
<p>You can <a href="/resource/install/">find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="note-online-help" class="section level3">
<h3>Note: Online help</h3>
<p>Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and its always the tiny errors in your coding can result in tons of headache. People working in any syntax based software package at any level experience this!</p>
<p>But there are multiple resources online to help.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First you will have access to <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/" target="_blank">Data Camp</a> which allows you to relieve professional training that otherwise costs a lot of money. Is it perfect and flashy? Nope but it is interactive and if you pay attention, then R’s initial steep learning curve won’t feel much like an uphill battle.</p></li>
<li><p>Second two of the most important are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> (a Q&amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">RStudio Community</a> (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)). I freely admit that StackOverflow has saved me multiple hours of frustration. Just note if you have a syntax or process issue, both sites require you to produce a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example" target="_blank">minimally reproducible example</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Third using Twitter you can post R-related questions and content with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats" target="_blank">#rstats</a>. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.</p></li>
<li><p>Fourth searching for help with R on Google (or another indexed search site) can sometimes be tricky because the program name is,for a lack of a better explanation, a single letter.</p></li>
<li><p>Fifth we have a class chatroom at <a href="2021edp617.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> where you can poise a question. <strong>I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond quickly.</strong> (This is a rare instances where I keep notifications on so please utilize it!) Ask questions about the readings, exercises, and mini projects. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too.</p></li>
<li><p>Sixth and lastly you can send items by Slack or email me with questions about content, R or whatever (after giving a graduate student effort of course). Please include the subject header <strong>EDP 617 “the title of your email”</strong> where the title of your email is given without the quotes. If you do email me, please include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brief description of the problem and what you have done thus far including the line number of the issue (if applicable).</li>
<li>A copy of your data set (if applicable).</li>
<li>A copy of your script or Rmarkdown document with comments throughout so I know what you’ve tried historically leading up to the issue.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I have a mail filter that will automatically bring your email to a top priority status.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>You should absolutely expect to struggle at times, but there is no better and more satisfying feeling than figuring things out for yourself! In the long run, you’re more likely to remember things you’ve figured out rather than those you’ve been shown or told.</p>

<h3>Your hours</h3>
<p>Please watch this video:</p>

<p>Your hours (formerly known as office hours) are set times dedicated to you the student!<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>). This means that I will be <del>in my office</del> at home waiting for you to <del>come by</del> talk to me remotely with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.</p>
<p>Because of the pandemic, we cannot meet in person. I can meet you online via Zoom. You can request a meeting through the calendar, e-mail or Slack.</p>
</div>
<div id="class-conduct-and-expectations" class="section level3">
<h3>Class conduct and expectations</h3>
<p>Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up with or stole from other professors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Late work</strong>: Barring the three main course tasks, past due deliverables will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via eCampus. There are no exceptions to this policy. Please note that I will not accept coursework by email or any other means.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Participation</strong>: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate in class. Engagement is mostly defined by you—if that means commenting and answering questions, neat; if it means sitting quietly and being focused, also neat; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off, not so neat.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justifications</strong>: On any submission, you must justiofy any assertion. I don’t know what you know so its your job to provide all of the necessary evidence to convince me that you do know what you say you know. While you’ve probably heard this multiple times over your life, think of it this way: if someone tells you that <em>not only is the Earth flat, the core is actually made out of tiramisu and moscato</em>, the first question you should be asking is <em>what’s your evidence?</em> possibly followed by <em>is the core delicious?</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rubrics</strong>: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level, I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:<br></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), a rubric isn’t often provided.</li>
<li>If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up).</li>
<li>Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor.</li>
<li>Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!
<br>
<br></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology use</strong>: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. We’re all adults<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>My philosophy</strong>:<br></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Just assume that all submissions are formal and must be submitted with the appropriate use of language, grammar, syntax, etc. and follow standard APA 7th edition formatting guidelines where applicable.</li>
<li>People who are easily offended by content, believe their work to be flawless or are generally unable to handle criticism should consider looking at another course. If you want rainbows and ponies, consider another class. If you care about data, fieldwork and learning a highly marketable practice, you’ve come to the right place.</li>
<li>There is a great deal of content in this course and you will likely struggle with some at times. Given that, there is also something to be said about the satisfaction a person gets when figuring something out, but nowhere is it written that has to be on your own. You may find that a nudge here or there elicits the same feeling so please reach out for help.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="learning-and-knowledge-during-a-pandemic" class="section level3">
<h3>Learning and knowledge during a pandemic</h3>
<p>When course objectives are written explicitly and clearly, they provide the information you need to figure out what a student should be able to do by the end of a given term. In fact, professors often test your proficiency in an area through multiple assessments such as exams, papers, presentations, etc where you are essentially asked to show us what you have <em>learned</em>. However learning is not the same as knowledge .</p>
<p>To save you from a long philosophical narrative on epistemology, in a nutshell we humans aren’t that good at evaluating a person’s knowledge mainly because its not a well-defined concept. With that said, we believe one indicator of knowledge is in a person’s ability to successfully explain a high level concept in such a way that the lay person can understand it. Every so often, consider asking yourself this:</p>
<div class="text-center">
<p>Can I describe <em>whatever</em> using language so that anyone could understand it?</p>
</div>
<p>On top of what’s noted above and I’m not sure how to articulate this any better - life sucks right now! It is likely by now you know people who have been hospitalized or passed away, lost their jobs, and/or tested positive for COVID-19. Additionally stresses in life are up. Given this, here is my promise to you:</p>
<div class="text-center">
<p><strong>If you keep an open line, show initiative, and let me know ahead of time if something is going not according to plan<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, I will do everything I can to help you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class!</strong></p>

<div id="course-policies" class="section level2">
<h2>Course policies</h2>
<div class="text-center">
<p><strong>Its pretty simple: Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat. Stay in touch. Be a good human.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>We will also follow <a href="https://studentconduct.wvu.edu/campus-student-code" target="_blank">WVU’s Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>This syllabus reflects a plan for the term but things change and plans change. so deviations may become necessary as we move along during the term. Note that <strong>I reserve the right to alter or amend this syllabus</strong> and will send notifications if course tasks are affected.</p>
</div>
<div id="covid-19-statement" class="section level2">
<h2>COVID-19 Statement</h2>
<p>WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.</p>
<p>In a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe the social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines set by the University at all times. While in class, students will sit in assigned seats when applicable and wear the required PPE. Should a student forget to bring the required PPE, PPE will be available in the building for students to acquire. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.</p>
<p>If a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes.</p>
<div id="psychological-and-psychiatric-services" class="section level3">
<h3>Psychological and Psychiatric Services</h3>
<p>Life at WVU can be complicated and challenging, especially during a pandemic! You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. <a href="https://carruth.wvu.edu/home" target="_blank">Psychological and Psychiatric Services</a> provides free, <em>confidential</em> support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The office is staffed by professional counselors and psychiatrists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students.

<h3>Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI)</h3>
<p>Effective teaching is a primary mission of West Virginia University. Student evaluation of instruction provides the university and the instructor with feedback about your experiences in the course for review and course improvement. Your participation in the evaluation of course instruction is both strongly encouraged and highly valued. Results are strictly confidential, anonymous, and not available to the instructor until after final grades are released by Admissions and Records. Information about how you can complete this evaluation will be provided later.</p>

<div id="university-attendance-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>University Attendance Policy</h3>
<p>At West Virginia University, class attendance contributes significantly to academic success. Students who attend classes regularly tend to earn higher grades and have higher passing rates in courses. Excessive absences may jeopardize students’ grades or even their ability to continue in their courses. There is a strong correlation between regular class attendance and academic success.</p>

<div id="course-netiquette" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Netiquette</h3>
<p>The basic premise is that the etiquette expected of students in the online environment is the same as that expected in a classroom. Common courtesy is the guiding rule of Internet communications. Be prepared to communicate effectively when taking an online course. Following these simple netiquette rules in your online class or education environment will ensure your success:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include a professional salutation. In this case, “Hello Dr. Roy” or “Dear Dr. Roy” is appropriate.</li>
<li>Include a proper ending such as “Thank you” or “With regards.” Then type in your full name.</li>
<li>Never type in ALL CAPS, because it reads as if you ARE SHOUTING AT PEOPLE.</li>
<li>Act as professionally, via your writing, as you would in a face to face classroom.</li>
<li>Refrain from inappropriate language and derogatory or personal attacks.</li>
<li>Do not dominate any discussion. Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion.</li>
<li>Disagree with ideas but avoid challenges that may be interpreted as a personal attack.</li>
<li>Check that you are replying to the specific person you intend, and not to the entire class.</li>
<li>Never give your password to another person.</li>
<li>Respect the virtual classroom. Never forward in-class communications or posts by others outside of this virtual space.</li>
<li>Never spam your classmates.</li>
<li>If you quote someone’s previous post, only quote enough to make your point.</li>
</ul>

<div id="response-time" class="section level3">
<h3>Response Time</h3>
<p>I generally respond to Slack queries in the same day while responses to emails and discussion posts are within 48 hours, except during holidays. Often, I will reply much more quickly but you should not count on a immediate. Please plan accordingly so that you don’t miss deadlines! I generally return assignments within one to two weeks after a final submission date.</p>
