# Interactive Data Visualization 

In this task, you will use R, in particular RStudio to create a set of interactive visuals based on a predefined data set. *Ideally you should work with one you intend to use for your final project.* Please make sure you follow the directions noted below. 

## Step I: Prospectus

This submission is due in **one week** and only applies to you **if there is a change from the data set used in the R Project**. =

## Step II: Visualization

Create an interactive application where users can explore your data set. How that is done is up to you.

This is likely your first attempt at creating a Shiny app so consider creating a simple app. Given this, you also an opportunity to take the design and functionality further and to do something a little more challenging. 

### Resources

### Assessment of Visualization

Some areas that you will be assessed on include

+ Your ability to describe an entire data set within your data visualization without additional explanation.

+ Ensuring a minimal amount of text is given in such a way that your app tells the story

+ The use of color and aesthetics in general. 

+ An attention to detail such as labeling, scope, and clarity.

+ Including directions on how to the app.
